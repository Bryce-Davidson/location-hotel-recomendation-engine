ChIJq9Z_wrBzj1QRTxNDocvoQk8,"The Vic, Ascend Hotel Collection",4.4,48.4427029,-123.3861167,82,"Everything was amazing! The room was spotless and tidy, wholly renovated, relaxed, quiet, and cozy. The beds and linens were super comfy and clean. The decoration was modern and chic. The bathroom was really clean. Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful. They put some chocolates and a lovely welcome letter for us in the room. Moreover, the location is perfect! Only a few minutes to downtown and excellent access to everything! We enjoyed our stay at this fantastic hotel. We'll definitely get back here again. Strongly recommended!AWESOME! Great room with board games, Foosball, ping-pong,TV and couches. Free complimentary snacks... Have you ever seen a mirror with a power button?! I haven't until I went to our room. We were like two idiots pressing buttons on and off.. great shower.... comfortable beds (except for pillows, but it's just me). The staff checked with us after we arrived if everything is good. We liked everything but breakfast. Flat pancakes that are hard to cut, oversugared waffles... I don't know. The rest is awesome.Pros: clean rooms, comfortable beds with great bedding, good location just outside of downtown, friendly service, an a nice rec room. Breakfast was tasty. Plenty of parking too.
Cons: There are no ironing boards or irons in the rooms, you have to call reception to request it. Which leads to the second problem: there are no clear instructions to dial reception anywhere in the room or on the phone. No vending machines, and only food and drink source in the hotel closes at 3 pm. Had to walk to an attached liquor store to buy a pop and chips.

Recommendation to hotel: Include a welcoming guide with information on how to dial reception (unless it's was only missing only in room 244) and how to get an iron/ironing board, essential for clientele. Partner up with a vending machine owner, usually it's free!

Overall: It's a good hotel, but I'll try a different hotel next time.The rooms are cute and clean and the staff are very attentive. One of my concerns was around safety - we came home around 10 pm on Thursday and couldn‚Äôt find parking, so we went to the underground parking. It was empty, except for a disheveled looking man smoking something. As two girls travelling by ourselves we did not feel safe parking there. We eventually found a spot outside. I would recommend the hotel add a gate or other security feature in the future. Otherwise we would definitely stay here again.Hotel is good and amenities are great üëç
Too bright at night tho. Rooms are good size and comfortable. My bed had some issues but not enough to bother staff. The price was amazing for what you get!
Only feedback would be training better staff when dealing with some complaints but overall the hotel was more than great!"
ChIJ4Rxmw5p0j1QRS4ikaNyNDds,Bedford Regency Hotel,3.6,48.4255461,-123.3678074,373,"My husband and I regularly stay in a harbour view room on the 3rd floor and we love it, especially the wood burning fireplace and the jacuzzi tub. This is an old building, but immaculately clean and comfortable. The location is ideal for checking out the sights and scene of downtown Victoria. The staff are wonderful as well. 100 percent would recommend!Spent a couple days at this hotel. I found it quite charming, I loved the older style architecture and styling choices. It wasn‚Äôt just another bland business hotel. It was a great price in the heart of downtown  Victoria and had two pubs on either side. The carpet was actually really thick and they had personal AC for each room. The staff was friendly and prompt (when the elevators broke in the morning they were fixed by the time I returned in the late evening). The bed wasn‚Äôt the comfiest and I wasn‚Äôt a fan of how my room window was facing the windows of other rooms across from me (separated by about 2 - 3 meters). I didn‚Äôt see anyone else in the other rooms but if it was busier it may have been more of a hinderance.

Overall, I would visit it again and recommend for others who are cost conscious and looking for a unique feel.Clean, very friendly and efficient staff, and within 15-20 minute walking distance to everything you'd want to see near the old town. Nothing fancy, but it's comfortable and comes with all the basic amenities. My booking came with breakfast at the Bard & Banker which was excellent, and the hotel lets you leave your bag free of charge at reception if you want to check out in the morning, but will not be leaving the island until the evening.Lovely boutique style hotel, reminds me of Paris! Fabulous location to park your car offsite, and walk to everything. Dozens of restaurants with outdoor patio seating as well all within walking distance. Our room was quiet, very clean, recently updated and the only downside was a lack of working plug-ins...but it did not hinder a great three night stay. Would absolutely  stay again and great value in the inner harbourSuper cute hotel. Will stay again.
You can hear the music from pubs, but considering it's in the heart of vibrant Old Town, it was fine. You feel like you're in the mix of things. Everything is within walking distance. Enjoy your stay!"
ChIJccwg7HBzj1QRzs4hO1A-GWU,Days Inn by Wyndham Victoria Uptown,3.7,48.44283919999999,-123.3825082,847,"This is actually pretty decent place to crash a night if you are in budget. The check in and check out process were very straightforward. I could access my room from side stairs so that was a bonus. No unnecessary noises or anything, comfy beds. So I mean you can't go wrong with their affordable nightly tariff. Locations is not bad either, apparently there is a path that leads straight to downtown. Also it's near Selkirk Trestle so at night time you and your friends can take advantage and check out that spot as it comes in one of the places to see when in Victoria. Overall I was very satisfied and if you want to visit Victoria in a budget, you should def consider this.This is an older hotel but the rooms were clean. Probably could do with a little TLC. We only needed a place for our head at night so it did what it needed to do. Definitely not a romantic getaway if that's what you're looking for. The staff however were amazing, so friendly, so helpful, 100% on the staff.
This hotel is a 10 min taxi ride or drive into Victoria harbor, give or take with the traffic. I wouldn't recommend it, and I wouldn't deter people from staying here, just depends on what you're looking for.
Side note, it did look like there was lower income residents staying here also.This was part of a package deal with BC ferries, so I drove down from Sidney.  It has a fantastic location, directly across the street from Black Ball Ferry and the Victoria Clipper. Easily walkable to all the Inner Harbor attractions. Staff are great, food service is FAST! Only 2 things- the room I had-409- has a funky bathroom- it is one step up from the rest of the room while the toilet is very low. You may also want to check the temp of the hot water supply as it easily reaches a high enough temp to make a cup of tea and can be difficult to lower to a more tolerable temperature.
On the other hand WHERE can I purchase your pillows!!
Will definitely stay here again. Oh! The price is very reasonable.My expectations were different and I‚Äôm very disappointed. First, this hotel is way overpriced. I payed ~210 USD for a standard room which is a lot. The room has a parking lot view which isn‚Äôt great. The room is average sized. Facilities wise I was shocked to hear that they don‚Äôt have dental kits or even drinking water bottles. I need to fill up my water bottle from the gym and when I went there I found the water dispenser to be almost empty. I‚Äôm very disappointed with the stay. Better to spend a few more bucks and stay at a classier place such as Sheraton. I‚Äôm never going to any Days Inn again. Manveen was courteous and her hospitality was good.Pretty nice hotel.Little expensive but the rooms were pretty huge with the kitchenette. Also they have a beautiful water view from the place. Have a lot of parking. They do not have breakfast options as they have their own restaurant downstairs, so it could be a technique to get people into their own pub. Staff was helpful. Lighting is less in the room. They just have 2 lamps for Lighting."
ChIJTXYT-Z5zj1QRJiu1ds-766c,Red Lion Inn & Suites Victoria,3.9,48.4513519,-123.3750287,1184,"Unfortunately I found that the housekeeping wasn't what I would have liked. Corners weren't cleaned and it looked as if someone had been sitting on one of the beds. But other than that, decently clean. The fire door by my room would only close if you pulled it closed, so was always open, so much for stopping the flames from spreading. The good point was the well worn pool. It was a nice temperature and good size. Because of that pool I will try this hotel again.Hotel is ok for the price.  Everything was clean.  What sets this property apart from others is that front desk staff are exceptionally courteous and beyond-the-call personable.  Manager Chris couldn‚Äôt do enough to be helpful; personable and friendly.  Good experience.  It‚Äôs a little out of the city center, but there is good bus service to city center and a taxi is about $15 Canadian.A great location, close to Uptown mall and a brisk walk to downtown.  Galloping Goose trail runs behind the hotel and transports you to hidden beauty. Only issue is garbage collection in parking lot behind our room at 4:30 am a couple times. But desk staff and maid service is excellent and polite.While visibly old and a ""budget"" option, we loved our stay at Red Lion Inn. We got a half-basement suite with a kitchenette and were pleasantly surprised to find all essential kitchen items, which saved us for lunch and breakfast times. There was an electric stove, pot, pan, a sizeable refrigerator, microwave, coffee maker, kettle, plates, bowls, spoons and forks. It is an old building but it's clean and good quality. It was also right on the highway and near stores and shopping complexes, which was very convenient.Hotel is a bit old and rooms a little small, but price is excellent. Chinese restaurant in basement is adequate but price is expensive compared to other Chinese restaurants.  Attitude at restaurant also not the friendliest.  Location is perfect being in the middle between downtown and ferry terminal / Butchart Gardens, etc. But need a car to make it work."
ChIJa6Bl9Jtzj1QR8VMk7xb885k,Accent Inns Victoria,4.1,48.4500555,-123.3682031,814,"Cannot say enough about this wonderful place!  Actually, it‚Äôs the people and their limitless kindness who made it a place to remember.   I was in town for my dog‚Äôs surgery at the nearby animal hospital.  From contactless check in, personalized notes in my room, constant offers of help to make things easier, to inquiring about my dog‚Äôs status.  I have never stayed anywhere with such amazing customer service and I highly recommend the Accent Inn to anyone looking for a great place to stay.  Being pet friendly was just a bonus!  They really go above and beyond and I am SO grateful!I spent a week in Victoria in May with my husband, and we stayed at the Accent Inn on Maple street.  The service was impeccable and there is communication everywhere as to what amenities are available, who to contact and although we didn't need service, I felt the staff would be very attentive to any need.  The room was clean, and cleaned well during our stay, and the burger restaurant on site was great.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Victoria area who wants to drive or take transit as it's not far from downtown and is in a great location!Very friendly, nice staff. Beds were comfortable. Basic necessities ok. But it's an old-style motel that really needs to be upgraded or better yet, rebuilt. We only stayed there cause pets were allowed and it was fairly reasonable, though for a bit more, we could had a nicer hotel (without the dog)The room is a motel room, it was clean and as expected, but nothing fancy. But what puts this place over the top is the service. Staff were all incredibly friendly, accommodating, and willing to go above and beyond. Accent Inns offers free bike rentals for guests as well. Location is good, a short drive or convenient bus ride to downtown Victoria.Great staff  level of excellence is high in all departments.  Located right in the heart of the city. Restaurant on site has a great selection of food and drinks. Beds are superior to most in the industry and who dsnt like a ruby ducky waiting for in the tub!!!"
ChIJc1X-toV0j1QRoz5sM-_rmBk,Ocean Island Inn Backpackers Suites,3.9,48.4276561,-123.3619654,1076,"I‚Äôve stayed here twice now, and have had nothing but great experiences. The facilities are very clean and the staff are always so friendly and willing to answer any questions. The rooms I have stayed in have been thoroughly cleaned and the shared bathrooms have also always been clean when I‚Äôve used them. The location is so central and great transit wise! The building is older and has so much cool character and a great vibe. Also you can‚Äôt beat the free breakfast provided, such an awesome addition. I‚Äôve only had the dinner provided once but it was so good. They also have lockers you can leave your bag in for the day after you check out. I‚Äôd highly recommended staying here and I‚Äôll definitely be back!This is by far one of the best hostels I‚Äôve ever come across and I been to 25 countries and so so many hostels.
It was super clean and the room was just great.
The staff was great and super friendly.
The type of atmosphere you hope for in a hostel.
The laundry room was great . Easy to use front load washer and dryer.
The free breakfast was simple and convenient and the free dinner they offered every evening was just fantastic !
I honestly just loved this place and the location is amazing. Close to the bus to the ferry so easy to find and depart from.
I definitely recommend this place.
Hope to come stay again as it‚Äôs a jewel of a place that works well for every walk of life.This is a great hostel. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. As a budget traveller I really appreciated that breakfast and supper come with the room, it makes a huge different in how expensive it is to travel to Victoria. Nice atmosphere in the hostel, not a party place. A diverse clientele, mostly people in their 20's and 30's, but also some older visitors. The downtown location is easy to get around on foot or with the buses. I am a woman travelling alone and I felt safe, both in the hostel and walking around the surrounding neighbourhood.Like any good hostel, it has a welcoming atmosphere and feeling of community. My room was clean and cozy, and kind of smelled a little bit like a nicely scented candle‚Ä¶? As someone who was visiting on foot, it was a great location within walking distance of the ferry terminal, restaurants, and the venue I went to see a show at. Awesome that they include a complimentary meal and drink as well!This is a great hostel! I have one of the micro room's, it's very clean, a nice bed that's pretty comfortable, window right beside the bed too which I love. The bathroom's are very clean. Location is great. A free lager beer down in the lounge for each night's stay is a nice touch too. Definitely among the best hostel's I've stayed at, I will come here again!"
ChIJEzpymnhzj1QR6WYd_lFwBbk,Arbutus Inn,3.6,48.4416375,-123.3698298,391,"Had a very nice stay :) exactly what we expected for a reasonable price. Rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and polite. Would definitely stay again!We had a few of our guys stay at the Arbutus Inn for 2 weeks for a job they were doing in Victoria. We were so happy with the service and cleanliness of the hotel. We also appreciated Claudio the manager‚Äôs awesome service and all the stuff that he went above and beyond for us. Will use this hotel again in the future for sure!!The walls were dirty and had holes in some of them.
The microwave in our room was old and didn't work properly.
The plates for the outlets were practically coming off the wall, I pulled out my cell charger and hafl the plate started to bend out.
The AC didn't work properly, At one point water started dripping out of it right on to an electrical wall heater.
The staff were very nice but this place needs a bit of an update.5 stars for the cleanliness and other services but I am very upset with the behaviour of staff member. We were group of 8 people and booked two rooms. We were playing music at night having our dinner. Then, Receptionist guy come in the room. He didn‚Äôt ask for the permission to enter the room, which was totally unacceptable. Then he just threatened us if you guys are not going to stop the music your both rooms will be seized (in very bad manner). I agree the music volume was high, we co-operate with guy. But the thing is he should ask us for permission to enter the room. The second thing he should warn us first or tell us that your music is loud, please stop it.

I know we were also at fault to play the loud music. But that person should know about ethics and customer service.It's too good to stay at. Rooms are very nice . Staff is very accommodating. Every happing place is around 20 - 25 minutes drive only"
ChIJ0QaAqZZ0j1QRYg4YTePJCeY,Robert Porter Inn,4.4,48.4181936,-123.3665835,46,"Great location. Parking is extra $ but secure and easy to get to. Bed is super comfortable! And the area quiet.
Place is a bit run down and not 100% clean. Side table, floors and toilet could have used a better wipe down. Kind of a strange set up with the huge tub in the middle of the room. Took forever to fill and then the jets didn‚Äôt work. Kitchen set up could be better by adding a counter and taking out the clothing rack. You are in an old house so you do hear other people easily but luckily all the other guests were quiet when I was there
But at the price, the location the wonderful bed and the garden view. I‚Äôd stay here again!The deluxe family suite is without a doubt, the most wonderful home away from home we could hope for. Everything has exceeded expectations and we will definitely be back in the future. I highly recommend this gem.It was was like visiting Europe with the old fashioned touches and brick. Lovely gardens. Unique suites named after artists. Our roomBoth Cindy and Johnny were warm and welcoming! Our suite was goegeous with a large free standing tub. We came for snowmegeden 2022 and the paths were cleared by the time we woke up the morning which we greatly appreciated ! The location of this place is second to none its a 3 mim walk to the heart of the waterfront. Great for tourists !Maclure Suite-3.5/4

Beautiful beautiful spot. Aspects of this amazing place are 5 Star all day long. Could be. Should be 5 star.  This place has it all.  Location. Gracious hosts. On site management. Character.  Charm. Space.  Fire places in almost every room ad an amazing ambiance.  The dining room and kitchen are grand.  The ceilings are high.  The lighting is good. The newly renovated bathrooms are beautiful. The towels are fresh. The rain showers a nice touch.  The heritage decor is on point.  There is no lack of amenities from the kitchen to the bathrooms.  The beds are comfortable and the bedding nice. The areas that could use improvement include the aging parts of the kitchen with some drawers and cupboards falling apart.  Faces coming off.  For such a grand kitchen the apartment size refrigerator is underwhelming. This would be an obvious upgrade. Something stainless with ice and water etc. The frying pans where all but useless.  Having said that any feedback we had for Cindy and Bernie was well received and responded to promptly with an expressed desire to make it right. They seemed to appreciate the feedback.  We were impressed with this level of care on Thanksgiving weekend.

There are fans but no AC.  Was a little warm. Windows don‚Äôt open. Everything above head height in the unit needs a deep deep clean. Thick dust.

All in all we will return. We would recommend. With some deep cleaning and a few items attended to it would not take much for this beautiful place to be a consistent 5 star.

Bernie and Cindy said someone would come over while we were out today to address the pans and the drawers and the cleaning. Someone did come around 7:00 pm after we returned home from a day out to clean a chandelier.   New pans were delivered today.  That was nice.  A deep clean of the whole unit of everything above head height is still in order to deal with thick dust and cobwebs.  The kitchen drawer is still broken.  I‚Äôm sure it will be fixed soon."
ChIJiZ3O9Yp0j1QRUxvZ6KYUYa8,The Craigmyle,4.2,48.4227279,-123.3445932,232,"Lovely old house, if old fashioned charm is what you're looking for this place is perfect.  Very clean, everything is updated as in state of the art showers and big comfy bed.  Rooms are small but the common area is large and welcoming.  Bring your own food as there is a kitchen for your useI have stayed at this charming boutique hotel in the past and had a fantastic experience. This time, the stay was very, very disappointing. The room was freezing cold, yet the description of the room clearly states there is no AC, not no heat. Also, the delicious breakfast was no longer included (yet the descriptions say free breakfast), the room and other areas were dirty, the coffee and hot water decanters downstairs were not refilled, and the shower head fell down and injured my daughter. Don‚Äôt expect to be able to plug in your devices either as there is only 1 wall outlet for lamps, fans, and heaters. For these reasons, I feel the high room rates are not justified, and I no longer recommend this hotel.We had a wonderful stay. We had the master suit and it had its own little kitchen so we‚Äôre able to bring home our leftovers from all the yummy restaurants we ate at. We loved sitting in the common room after our walk downtown. The view is breathtaking and it was nice and quiet.
Anyone complaining about the water temperature never grew up in a house with many people, sometimes you need to wait for it to heat up or just get up early.
We will be back.I stayed two nights in March 2023. Great homey B'n'B. Helpful and friendly staff. Super clean establishment! Downtown is in walking distance (15min walk). Quite and historic neighbourhood with quite some huge sequoia trees. Highly recommended.This is NOT a Bed and Breakfast.  This is more like a hostel.  There is no lovely owner that lives on site offering delicious breakfasts.  There is a jar that says ""$10.00 extra and CASH ONLY"" for a bun and bacon.  No where on their website does it say it's NOT a B & B.  When we said, B & B's offer breakfast, he replied ""show me where it says you get breakfast for free, and I'll give it to you"".   Also there is NO Hot Water in the shower.  A sign says wait 30 minutes... well, there never was hot water in the shower.  It's by the Castle, and it's a decent price, but it's not a lovely old B & B."
ChIJ7eul4YR0j1QRZi486foA07A,Best Western Plus Carlton Plaza Hotel,4.3,48.42743189999999,-123.3653271,1170,"We stayed here knowing we'd be doing some walking so the location wasn't a huge deal to us. If you're not super mobile, I'd suggest a hotel closer to the wharf. It's really just a 10 min. walk to the waterfront if you're going straight there. Ruby's next door is a great place for breakfast and prices are reasonable. The rooms are on the smaller side (NYC size) but they are well appointed and freshly updated. I'd easily stay here again. Even better, the service can't be beat! Everyone was just so nice!A gem of a hotel if you can manage a little bit of noise. My husband was working out of town in Victoria so my son and I decided to tag along and get a vacation out of it at the same time. The hotel location is amazing. It is walking distance to basically everything. It is located on a busier street so you can hear the road noise in your room. The hotel is aware of this and kindly provides earplugs for those this may affect. My son is 7 months old and the noise did not disrupt his sleep or routine. I personally did not find the noise too bad.
The staff at this hotel was incredible. They were all beyond kind. The parking arrangement is valet only and they always had my husbands truck ready to go for him every morning. Super quick and efficient if we hadn‚Äôt previously scheduled it‚Ä¶however with everything in walking distance we didn‚Äôt find we used it in the evening.
The room was clean and had everything provided. House cleaning is based on request instead of everyday‚Ä¶which worked well for our situation.I recommend staying here if you want to receive excellent customer service! We hadn't been to beautiful Victoria since before the pandemic. We decided to take the Clipper with hope that we could truly enjoy the experience of not having to drive and be centrally nearby points of interest. This Hotel offered that to us. The room, our view, and the staff were also great! The staff was very gracious about storing our luggage while we had a short wait for our room to be ready. We had arrived before noon. They texted us to let us know when the room was ready. They also extended check out for us, and stored our luggage again while we had a late breakfast in the restaurant that is attached to the Hotel. The staff even called a taxi for us to take back to the Clipper ferry. We were treated very well.  We are looking forward to our next trip back!Smack in downtown, which is great! Room that was given to us was clean and neat (King + Sofa). Noise insulation from street was also decent. Restrooms were clean and furnished with the basic amenities. The staff was polite and quick. Also thing to note is that parking is Valet and could take 15 minutes or so for them to get your car out. Price paid for the room was slightly higher than expected, but would stay again based on cleanliness and the location.Located perfectly 10 min walk from harbour, in the downtown, Stuff, service is absolutely Awesome!! A  Specially thanks to manager Nadine- excellent people skills !!! Front desk guys- Brenton, Jessica, Steve.. and more.. excellent messaging system, we had agreement on free parking- but otherwise parking is expensive!! Hotel super clean and comfortable!! Definitely will stay again
Thanks"
ChIJbYOaZpd0j1QRiwuQ_nBWNzc,Days Inn by Wyndham Victoria On The Harbour,3.7,48.42110839999999,-123.3731683,679,"Our stay was good. Our room was a decent size, but the bathroom was much smaller than I expected. There is no fan in the bathroom, so everything got fogged up. There is no AC but had a fan in our room, and the window opened, that worked as it wasn't super hot. I'm not sure how well it would have been in hot temperatures.

They definitely seemed understaffed most of the time and had to wait like 15 minutes to get checked in as the only person was busy helping a very chat guest. Tried calling down, and no one answered and had to wait so we could get towels for the pool.

The pool was supposed to be heated, but it didn't seem like it. The hot tub was like being in a lukewarm hot tub, so that sucked.

It was a decent hotel as we were out exploring the Harbour more than hanging in the hotel. It's in a great spot to most tourist attractions nearby.Hotel seems old and has that old ""I've been on the harbour for 20 years"" smell. Not gross at all, just not fresh and new. Rooms are tight but very clean. Full bathroom and we had a little fridge and extra sink. Awesome location as it's right by the legislative assembly and museum etc.The hotel is in desperate need of an update.  It gets to the point where no matter how good your staff are, getting the place properly clean with cracks and such isn‚Äôt possible.   Floors are uneven, rooms are smelly, and the noise isn‚Äôt a joke.  The restaurant in the hotel is mediocre at best.  Desk staff were very friendly.  Cleaning staff was kind.  Manager was micromanaging everything and we were embarrassed by changes she made making people run around unnecessarily.  Absolutely a 1.5 star hotel in a 5 star location.Great location. I liked the pub on the main floor, though, there are lots of better options within walking distance. Avoid staying on the second floor (directly above the pub) and bring ear plugs. The sound insulation for the hotel, overall, is very poor. I could clearly hear the normal volume conversation of the people staying in the adjacent room, and, I presume, they could equally easily hear us.

There are lots of other hotels in the vicinity, and this one seems to get a low rating in comparison to the others. I would suggest looking around for a different hotel in the area, if you are able. Loved the easy walking access to the Victoria restaurant district, though.As soon as we entered the room we could smell the floor cleaning chemical. Maybe housekeeping just cleaned it before the check in time but it was so hard to breathe with that pungent smell. We had to keep the windows open for couple hours to get rid of it. Otherwise the location is great and staff was friendly and welcoming especially the brown guy on the reception."
ChIJiRA_MpB0j1QRjzY50no1W9Y,Quality Inn Downtown Inner Harbour,3.6,48.4225335,-123.3633116,540,"I really like this hotel. Rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and it's in a great location. My only issue is it's loud. Walls are paper thin. If you're a deep sleeper or wear ear plugs you'll be ok. My last stay there were a group of guys in their 20s on my floor. I had a feeling it would be a long night. Needless to say it was very loud around 3am and the front desk needed to be called. I'm sure it's not always like this as it was a Saturday and the hotel is close to the bars. Other than that I've enjoyed my stay both times.Had a 4 night stay. Nice comfortable room,though it wasn't serviced while we were there. I guess we could have requested it. They apparently were short staffed so didn't see a need to ask. Reception staff were helpful and check in was pretty quick. Breakfast was available and though pretty basic did the job and the staff were very friendly.I and my friends wanted to thank how grateful we were to the Male receptionist who was on shift on June 18th at around 12 midnight. We came all the way from Vancouver, I and my friends were looking for a hotel in Victoria Downtown. We had already searched for 3 hotels and all were full and it was already late at night, this kind Man in Quality Inn hotel was really sorry that there were no available room for us to accommodate, BUT he never hesitated to help us and he searched for a 24 hours room for us to stay for the night. He recommended us a place where we can stay. Thank you so much sir. We might not get your name but truly your such a great help. Keep up!For the excellent location, big room, free coffee/ tea / water (a cup), friendly staffs, accessible to bus or ferry connector, etc. This 2 star hotel/ Inn is definitely a keeper on my list if I ever visit Victoria. Of course, just need to aware this is a kid and pet friendly place and therefore it could be noisy.  I would recommend this hotel/Inn to anyone who interested to visit Victoria.I assumed most well-known chain hotels would have air conditioning, but this one does not (and the windows only open a fraction). Do not stay here in hot temps (it hit 30 degrees today and our room is unbearable). For $250 a night, I would have hoped to be a comfortable temperature."
ChIJ98FwcZx0j1QRy0NxLI4DRuE,Delta Hotels by Marriott Victoria Ocean Pointe Resort,4.4,48.4270968,-123.3748502,2304,"Hotel itself is nice and have a good view. However the service isn‚Äôt top tier. We are gold elite member and request for room upgrade. They staff said already upgraded to water view deluxe room but when we open the room and like excuse me???? Water view??? We feel being scammed!! We are disappointed because the view is obstructed. This is the UPGRADE they gave very good. Feels like downgrade for real. We arrive 3:30pm and they said they room isn‚Äôt ready yet. We are feel not good and our sense is true when we see the room they upgrade to us. First is low floor second there is not privacy at all with facing the street we have to keep curtain closed all time. Also we asking about club lounge access for gold elite member they front desk staff is not clear too and we are confused whether we can access or not then they just told me we can‚Äôt need to pay $60/night fee that‚Äôs totally different they they replied me in email. Feel not worth to stay here next time will find better hotelsHad a family vacation here and had a really wonderful experience. Very ideally located - away from the downtown hustle and bustle but still very close and ocean view is simply amazing. Can get a superb view of the Legislative Building from the windows of the hotel. The staff is very courteous and helpful.The view of the harbor is spectacular, boats, seaplanes and people walking about. The lights at night are very pretty. Rooms are comfortable, staff is attentive, this is probably the only place I will stay at in Victoria in the future. Knocking off 1 star for service because the hot tub was broken for our entire stay, but that's probably too harsh....We recently had our wedding at the Delta, and it was a wonderful experience. The venue itself is beautiful. The large windows of the Harbour Room allowed us to dine with the beautiful Inner Harbour as a backdrop. It also allowed for our attendees to easily enjoy the evening inside and outside on the harbour walk. The Saxe Pointe Buffet was delicious, with the meat cooked to perfection and well seasoned sides. The buffet also contained a selection of tasty desserts. The late-night snack was equally delicious, allowing for a tasty comfort food element while taking special dietary restrictions into account. The bar staff were very friendly and knowledgeable. They made a wide variety of acholic and non-alcoholic drinks, and were a hit with the guests.

The event coordinators that we worked with, Julianna and Mairin, were fantastic. They were more than happy to take time out of their busy schedules to walk us through the space, both virtually and physically. Julianna was particularly flexible, and her team was accommodating and friendly.  She helped us print special menus in multiple languages so that all guests felt included in the dinner.

There were a couple facilities issues. First, music from the room above randomly played through the speakers of our room, interrupting speeches. Second, the dance floor had noticeable gaps between panes, big enough for a high-heel or toe to get caught in. These were minor issues, and more to do with their AV contractors than the Delta itself.I have been here two times, first time was a few years ago, and second time on February. I liked it both times, mostly first time because of the service and management. My review is about second time.
About the service:
We arrived there around 9:30, they were not busy but it took them so long to come and check on us, or take the orders.
About the food:
our breakfast was fresh and delicious. I loved the cute fruit bowl.
I dont give 3 stars just to say something bad. These reviews help businesses to improve and I told my view about their service only because I think its good for them to know what to work on. :)"

The hotel's thoughtful remodeling efforts, combined with its excellent location and welcoming staff, created an enjoyable and memorable experience. While it may not be ideal for families with little children, it offers a comfortable and convenient stay for travelers of all kinds. I highly recommend.Great hotel, the beds were clean and comfortable, bathrooms were clean and well equipped. I actually prefer the laminate in the rooms instead of carpet. Good location in the centre of downtown with $10 surface parking. Only thing I didn't like was the view from the room, a brick wall.Great location for a great price. Room is very clean and quiet, and the person at the front desk was very helpful each time I interacted with them. Would definitely stay here again if I visit in the future.Our 3 night at Strathcona Hotel was outstanding. The location puts you at the centre of action in downtown Victoria and the staff were fantastic. Thanks to Aisha, Susan, Angelica, Diego and Nitin - you guys rock!Well. I saw other rooms and they were more updated but the ‚Äúqueen‚Äù room they gave me (311) felt like a repurposed storage room. Or maybe an interrogation room with the glaring yellow light overhead. Yes it fit a queen bed but not much else. Bathroom was very outdated and the grout painted black was an interesting touch. To hide mildew stains?  Sink water pressure was enough to rinse a toothbrush but not much else. Disappointing weekend ‚Äúgetaway‚Äù."
ChIJhS7IfIF0j1QRHGLK7AgNNJ0,Helm's Inn,4.4,48.4186561,-123.3658685,394,"A great location opposite the most stunning park. The beds were super comfortable even if I needed a stepladder to get into them!!! Clean and the little kitchen was very well equipped. The only downside is our room is located directly behind reception and the curtains allowed a lot of light in and we had quite a bit of noise from footsteps upstairs but not a massive problem.Very happy that we booked here.
Located behind BC Museum, across the street from Beacon Hill Park. A very quiet area, easy walking distance to restaurants and other attractions.
Tidy motel with plenty of parking ($10 a night).
Very clean throughout. Friendly staff.
Our room was huge, with a full kitchen. The bathroom is a little small.The room was clean, kitchen was nice and beds were comfy. The staff were all nice and helpful. You hear footstep sound from upstairs but it wasnt too bad. Ïù¥Í∞ÄÍ≤©Ïóê Ïù¥Ï†ïÎèÑ Î™ªÏ∞æÏïÑÏöî!We have stayed twice the first room was 3 star level, the second room much better. Both times very clean, pretty good service. The first room was a bit dated 5 months ago.The best of this hotel is it's location.  Very comfortable, rooms with great space and has everything you need.  I stayed at this hotel on my last two vacations.  It is also located in front of the most beautiful park in Victoria. Parking is $10 per night."
ChIJj93NPuB1j1QRTyOWTECyoIA,Island Travel Inn,3.2,48.4309106,-123.364761,166,"The front desk staff were very helpful and friendly. The price was very reasonable, it is in a great location and includes free parking. It is within walking distance of downtown. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready but the let us leave our car in the parking lot while we explored the city.  There were a couple of cleanliness issues but nothing major and they were great about rectifying it when I talked to them.The bed linens are not washed. Blood stains on the linen sheet. How did that get missed?!
If I didn‚Äôt flip the linen they probably wouldn‚Äôt even bother cleaning it for the next customer. Disgusting!

I will never ever recommend this place to anybody and don‚Äôt be fooled by the prices either. Too cheap to even do proper cleaning.

To make it even worse the bath tub is growing mold and the floor under the beds aren‚Äôt vacuumed. Key cards left under the bed by previous customers.

The photos don‚Äôt really do justice.

If I could give this place - 10 stars I definitely would. We didn‚Äôt sleep at all.Conveniently located and friendly front desk staff. King beds were comfy. Room needed more thorough cleaning and maintenance. AC filter was so dirty that we cleaned it so that the AC would work. Bathtub drain was clogged. Bathroom fan was clogged with dirt. I don't recommend looking under the beds.If you want a cheaper, budget friendly option for a hotel this would do the trick. The location was handy to get around downtown but you have to listen to the crazy loud street sounds that go with it. Sirens from emergency vehicles going off almost constantly, traffic, and people yelling outside.
The wifi is terrible, the connection was constantly cutting in and out. Light bulbs missing in the room. The room was dated but liveable, doesn't look like they tried too hard to pretty it up if you're looking for atmosphere. The floor I stayed on was crazy hot (but not downstairs on the lobby floor...), turned the air conditioner on full blast just to attempt to sleep at night but even then it was still hot. No screen on window which I feel should be an issue?  Staff were rather blah and unimpressive, they didn't seem very happy any time I spoke to them. All in all a decent option if you aren't going to spend a whole lot of time in the room, you can tolerate noise, and don't mind the most basic of basic places to stay.Stop! If you are planning on staying here don't. If you like mice and bugs in your then book. If you like duct tape holding in the AC machine and not working good, then book. If you like to change rooms and the front desk says mice are common then book. If you like moving to another room with what looks like black mold around the tub, then book here. Yes to pay another 30-50 dollars to stay at a better hotel closer to downtown. PS- Don't take the stairs at the south end of the building,  feels like your going to fall thru."
ChIJSWcBap1zj1QRPeiOEdd9gIY,Hotel Zed Victoria,4.3,48.4460582,-123.3716106,987,"Title: A Fantastic Stay at Hotel Zed!

Review: My wife and I, recently stayed at Hotel Zed in Victoria, Vancouver Island, and it was an enjoyable experience from start to finish. The location is ideal, with easy access to downtown and the Uptown mall area.

The hotel staff were efficient and made the check-in process smooth and hassle-free. They even got us in early, which was a pleasant surprise. Their friendly and fun attitude added to the overall positive vibe of the hotel.

The room was clean, comfortable, and thoughtfully designed. It felt like a fun-funky home away from home with personality, equipped with amenities that enhanced our stay. We couldn't have asked for more.

Hotel Zed is full of charm and personality. The playful decor and unique touches create a vibrant atmosphere that sets it apart from other hotels. It's clear that they prioritize creating a fun-filled experience for their guests.

During our stay, we briefly enjoyed the retro-chic pool area, which provided entertainment and added to the overall enjoyment of our time there. We also appreciated the complimentary cruiser bikes (you read that right!!!), which allowed us to explore the city easily.

Overall, Hotel Zed in Victoria is a fantastic choice for a memorable stay. With its convenient location, efficient and friendly staff, smooth check-in process, and playful atmosphere, it exceeded our expectations.

I highly recommend Hotel Zed for a fun and enjoyable visit to Vancouver Island's capital city!We did not stay here, but were given the opportunities to store our luggage for free while we explored the inner harbour.  The hosts were both warm, welcoming & very helpful!  We saw that the place was clean & well cared for!  Thank you for making us feel so welcome & accommodating our needs, so cheerfully!  Gratefully, J & MAn old hotel that's been lovingly made into a destination by embracing retro vibes. If you want fancy and new, don't bother. If you want fun, retro, cozy, friendly and convenient, it's the whole package. The pool/hot tub/slide is nice, warm, and well maintained. Lots of staff working on the property. Less late night noise here than in the highrise hotels downtown.Stayed here back in August 2017. This hotel is awesome. The staff were friendly, the rooms were beautiful, and the location was close to a bus stop and in walking distance of shops. It was a good 3-day stay. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheaper hotel to stay at while in Victoria.Rooms are clean and spacious with a modern TV. The staff is nice and they offer regular cleaning. Great place for kids and it is in a good location.
Only few comments, my plane was at 8 and the staff wouldn't let me stay beyond 11:30. An hour or two would have been nicer. And a bottle of water and some coffee in the room would have made it more pleasant. You wouldn't feel like taking a walk to the reception every time you need a cup."
ChIJyUiW1Jl0j1QRUVX2cjNHVfk,Huntingdon Manor Hotel,4.0,48.4213859,-123.3752518,724,"This hotel is a good place to stay.  Close to the Clipper dock and is just a few minutes walking to the downtown area.  The hotel building and grounds are well kept. Our room was clean and well maintained.  No visible wear and tear. The breakfast buffet dining room is only accessible by stairs, there might have been another way in, but it was not obvious to me.  The food was well stocked with a variety of fruits, cereal, breads, eggs, meat, potatoes and yogurt.  The staff are friendly and helpful.

Just one cautionary item: if you need to exchange US dollars,  they will not give you the going exchange rate. This is the first time I ever encountered that scenario in BC.

We recommend this as a place to stay.The hotel is in a great location. You can walk the downtown area and many places. The service is wonderful. Everyone is nice and friendly. The food at the breakfast buffet has a variety of options, and the quality is great. The place is clean and cozy. The beds are comfortable. It's also quiet so you can relax and have a downtime and get a good night's sleep. The room and furniture just need some updating. It's outdated, but other than that, we had a wonderful stay and experience.The staff is extremely friendly, hospitable and professional from their front-end to back-end employees.

Our complimentary breakfast was delicious, offering a wide range of items. It can get busy during peak breakfast hours, but the staff is always accommodating in helping find a table for you right away. They also do an exceptional job keeping the buffet-style breakfast stations clean and tidy.

The room was very well kept and clean. This is obviously an older building, so noise transfer from room to room is very noticeable. Unfortunately, this was an oversight by the guests above our suite, but the hotel management was quick to offer a solution for us to move into another suite that was much quieter. I appreciated this so much as I am a very light sleeper and really sensitive to noise.

The manor is within walking distance to downtown Victoria, Chinatown and many different attractions, so I was able to leave my vehicle in the hotel's secured underground parking and didn't have to deal with Victoria's paid street parking.

I'm looking forward to coming back here as it was affordable, clean, and I felt very well looked after by the staff, but will likely request a suite on the top floor to get a more consistent quiet experience.We had flooding at our home and stayed in the family suite for a week until we could organize something more permanent.  It's a unique and beautiful hotel (anyone wanting to avoid a cookie cutter hotel chain will love it) but what really struck us was how wonderful the staff were.  We have nothing but praise for the people who work here!! There were extras we appreciated too -- a great breakfast buffet in a beautiful dining hall, overseen by really lovely and attentive staff; coin laundry; a water cooler to refill water bottles in the hallway; and secure underground  parking. Great location and very clean rooms with white duvet covers and sheets. Highly recommend.Pet friendly is what called us! The location and charm are the best parts of this hotel. The breakfast and service were wonderful. The rooms could use an upgrade but they are very reasonably priced. Covered parking was very convenient. Laundry is available. I'd go back"
ChIJiYEIrJF0j1QRzZmiWZXTSRA,Victoria Marriott Inner Harbour,4.4,48.4214776,-123.364647,1287,"This property is located close to downtown and the harbour, making it quick and easy to walk to or catch a bus to our destinations.

Service started at the front door with a smile and continued with front desk staff always available and friendly.

The bed here was probably the most comfortable one I've ever slept on in a hotel. Temperature was easy to control and noise levels were great as the property is not on a busy street. Hallway noise is evident when the hotel is busy but I brought a white noise machine that covered all of that overnight.

The restaurant was great if pricey for breakfast, custom locally made jam was amazing and the crab cake eggs Benedict was delicious.

Our only complaint was the lack of towels at the pool and the quality of them when they were available. They were very thin, meaning many guests seemed to take 2-4 each, which is probably why they ran out so often. I made calls to the front desk twice when the basket was empty and only once was it filled before we left the pool. Just a very small area of service that needs improvement.While this is a Marriott, (so you kind of expect a ""chain"" experience), the staff here make all the difference and take the time to look after guests. The manager was present and very attentive too. Traveling with dogs can be problematic and stressful, but they even had suggestions for local eateries that welcome dogs on the patio... The location is also a perfect blend of central yet quiet, with safe parking, and the room we were given was huge, clean, smelled pleasant and the bed was super comfy... This was our second visit, and I'm sure we will be back!Stayed here for one night while passing thru. The location is great it‚Äôs close to the downtown core and I‚Äôm walking distance of many restaurants and attractions. While we did not go anywhere and came in late night  and left early the 5 star review is solely for the staff. The check in staff was pleasant and informative and the check out experience was amazing. Even though the guy helping me had 2 people waiting and he was alone the moment I went to ask questions he did not rush me at all and took the time to ensure I had all the information I needed and went out of the way to ensure my trip went well despite the fact I was checking out. The hotel was clean, beds we‚Äôre comfortable staff was great.Hands down one of the best places I've stayed. Staff are super friendly and professional, they actually care about their guests. The rooms have an attention to detail that is second to none. Staff should be super proud of themselves. It's a choice to do your job that well and I for one am glad they made that choice. Thank you.I was there for couple of days when I was travelling to Victoria for work.
It‚Äôs relatively an old building but very clean and with super nice staff and great service.
-They only offer valet parking for $30 per night. There are couple of parkings in 5 minutes walking distance if you don‚Äôt want valet parking.
-They have a small but clean pool and gym.
-Rooms are clean and spacious.
- The best part is the location. It‚Äôs close to Victoria historic downtown and the harbour with a lot if great restaurants and bars in walking distance."

I recently had the pleasure of staying at the Sandman Victoria and where my experience and stay was very good, the service I had from the maintenance staff was exceptional!
During my stay, I had a ‚Äòsituation‚Äô that required immediate support from maintenance. When Wilson was dispatched to my room, he was so friendly and expeditious, that I felt inclined to share my feedback.
Wilson went above and beyond to discretely help me through my situation and throughout our interaction, I was so impressed with his warmth and professionalism. He was friendly, understanding and very proficient at fixing the issue.

It‚Äôs conveniently located in the heart of downtown, close to bus stops, and a Starbucks in the lobby. Service was SUPERB: from being greeted by 2 of the front desk staff, whom I had asked to store my luggage away as we had arrived there earlier than supposed check in (so we took this opportunity to go around the city), being helped by Herbert (?) at the reception when checking in (guys, he is AWESOME! Very welcoming, friendly, and will go out of his way to offer you the best room!), and getting room service for breakfast! The room we had was luxurious and had the best view!

BravoThis is the first time I have stayed at Double Tree and was pleasantly surprised. I loved the friendliness of the staff at the Victoria, BC location. I also love their cookies. The rooms was immaculately clean and the beds were very comfortable. This location was very central to everything after my business was completed I was able to navigate downtown and the harbor area of Victoria.
I loved the parking experience and the system was seamless. Overall, I would recommend this location for business or vacation.We stayed here for two nights. The rooms were clean and the beds were comfortable. The service was great. The front desk is helpful with any needs and questions. The location is close to the harbor and parliament.

ChIJW6942Ul0j1QRV66FpPVf4wo,Oak Bay Beach Hotel,4.6,48.4199482,-123.2994611,1549,"Hands down the best hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Perfect for our honeymoon! You absolutely get what you pay for. Even the cheapest room was extremely well furnished, with an amazing bathroom and jacuzzi tub. The facilities are top-notch, especially the mineral pool and hot tubs. Breathtaking views as well! If you have a car, booking through Oak Bay is a good deal for free parking. A bit out of the way from downtown, but that can also be a positive. We will be back soon!Stayed for a girls weekend and had the best time! Our room was beautiful, the beds were so comfortable, the view was fabulous. The hotel made sure we had everything we needed for our furry four-legged friend as well which was amazing. Dillon helped us and was absolutely fantastic and made the stay even more memorable - cannot say enough good things about him! We are already planning our next trip!My recent stay at the Oak Bay Beach Hotel was unfortunately not as enjoyable as I had hoped. While the hotel has some positive features such as the spacious and clean rooms and friendly staff, there were some limitations that detracted from the overall experience.

One major inconvenience was that the main restaurant was only open from Friday to Sunday, which meant that there were limited dining options during the weekdays. This could be particularly frustrating for guests who are looking to enjoy a full resort experience with on-site dining options.

Another issue was the spa facilities being fully booked, despite my attempt to make a reservation one week before my check-in date. This meant that my family and I were not able to enjoy the spa during our stay, which was disappointing. Additionally, the fact that the spa closes at 7 pm as a resort hotel could be inconvenient for guests who are looking for a more flexible schedule.

Furthermore, I was disappointed to find that the hotel only provided three sets of robes and slippers for a room with three guests, but only two sets of toothbrushes and bath supplies. This discrepancy in amenities could be frustrating for guests who expect consistency and completeness in the provision of hotel amenities.

Despite these limitations, there were some positive aspects of the hotel. The rooms were spacious and clean, with lovely ocean views. The staff were friendly and accommodating, and the mineral pool was warm and inviting.

Overall, while the Oak Bay Beach Hotel has some positive features, the limited hours of the main restaurant, difficulty in booking the spa facilities, and discrepancies in amenities provision could detract from the overall experience. It's important for potential guests to be aware of these limitations when considering a stay at the hotel.Beautiful property with an outstanding ocean view. The rooms are very comfortable, and each come equipped with a large bathtub and separate shower. The heated mineral pools are amazing. The service was excellent throughout our stay. Everyone from the valet, front desk, housekeeping, pool staff, etc. was very friendly and helpful.Great hotel! The heated tiles in the bathroom was a unique feature that I enjoyed after stepping back in from the pool/hot tubs. Staff is very friendly and the two in-house restaurants are great as well. I highly recommend the pizza place."

Beautiful town skyline views. The front desk staff were nice but not overly helpful or friendly. They seemed put out at having to wait on us.We stayed in April for an event. It‚Äôs very nice and convenient for the purpose of our visit.
The room itself is pretty nice and updated with plenty of cabinets. The soaker tub is also great. We had a room in the back of the building which is pretty chill and quiet. The elevator is pretty fast too. We asked for toothbrush and slippers which was sent to our room.

Cons: The room was pretty cold to my liking. There‚Äôs a maximum temperature one can set but it also warms up only a specific area of the room and can‚Äôt make the whole room warm enough.
The bed is a bit firm.
The towels and bath robes are quite rough  - maybe a bit old and need replacement.
Not enough coffee pods were provided for the length of our stay. I had to constantly ask for it.

Overall, we had a great stay.Very comfortable room. The staff was very accommodating in our requests, as we were on a bike tour with bikes.  The breakfast selection was fantastic.  We left a phone charger in the room at the end of our stay a were able to retrieve it a few days later. Great stay there.I had my parents stay at Hotel Grand Pacific. The room has a lovely view, and the amenities at the hotel were great. Many walkable places to explore from the hotel. Dinner at Fathom was outstanding!
My parents would like to give special thanks to Troy and Sunho for making their stay comfortable and extra special!!We have booked a bay view suite for the weekend.

We were looking for a suite with a kitchenette and Royal Scot had amazing online reviews. The hotel exceeded our expectations and was an incredible, seamless experience from check-in to check-out.

The team were friendly and helpful. Our room was very spacious and clean, in addition we received a complimentary upgrade from a Queen to King bed suite. I was surprised at how comfortable the bed was and how relaxing the shower was - great water pressure.

Like Victoria, the hotel has an old world charm and was well maintained, both interior and exterior. The location was amazing and central, 1/2 block from The Parliament and in the heart of the famed Inner Harbour - we walked everywhere with ease. We would highly recommend this hotel and it was a wonderful experience for our family. Thanks for the memorable stay!Stayed here with my family, it is an older property but very well maintained. It is clean and very cozy with a nice dividing wall between sleeping and tv/kitchen area. Halls were clean and quiet. I loved how quiet it was on the balcony.  The hotel is near the harbor but away from the noise of the main street. Good walking distance to the Harbour and downtown. Restaurant is clean and cozy with good food and service. Kids enjoyed the pool. Would definitely stay here again.We have stayed here many many times over the years.
The rooms are very well kept and comfortable.
The convenience of the hotels location make it easy to go in any direction on foot or by cab/car.
What really stands out is the friendly staff, in every position at the hotel. They make me smile and feel welcomed.
We will keep coming back as long as it stays open, for the comfort and ease of the staying here. This has been a special place for us and will continue to be.If I could give 0, I would. The hotel has not been renovated or updated in 30 years. It smells musky and moldy. It is decently clean, throw pillows on couches were stained, and couches were old, worn, and uninviting. Wall paper is peeling and carpets are worn out badly. Mismatched furniture is piled up with no sense of design or decoration.  The host/server in the restaurant was wearing street clothes and baseball hat. The food was ok, but considering the same price across the street in a newly renovated 5* restaurant,  it was overpriced. The bathroom was infested by ""silver fish"" bugs. The receptionist offered us a deep cleaning of our room or to be moved to a different room. I highly doubt that bugs were contained in one suite. There is no porter, and all entrances require key. It was outrageously priced considering all of the above. Lesson learned, though.April 3-6, 2023.  Great find for a moderately priced hotel within easy walking distance to the Victoria Clipper.  Friendly staff, particularly Kevin who provided shuttle service when I was too pooped to walk to my next destination.  Room was well appointed.  I didn‚Äôt get to use the pool, but was impressed at how clean it appeared to be.  So few folks shower before a dip, which is why I typically avoid hotel pools.  The on-site restaurant provided a nice breakfast too!"

We had drinks at the restaurant it was a vibe, the live music, crafted drinks really made it enjoyable. The shops are busy and on the far side of the hotel, great to check out.

Don't look at the cost of the room but the convivence of the location, the amenities that are offered. I would highly recommend for young families and anyone who wants to go out and explore Victoria and come back to the hotel for a rest and then go out again. Its so centrally located that you're able to make the most of your time.We stayed here while in town attending a friends wedding. I was on crutches at the time & the helpfulness of the staff was incredible.
The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet & comfortable.
The location is perfect.
The food & drinks were top of the line.

I will definitely be back !We were able to get in for the tea time as a walk in on a Sunday morning and I have to tell you that I‚Äôve never felt like royalty until that day! The tea was very delicious. The pastries and finger foods were absolutely delicious as well! The servers were very friendly and courteous, making sure you enjoyed the complete experience. A little pricey, but every once in a while, you deserve it! You can literally stay here for a few hours relaxing and talking because there are refills on the tea.A truly spectacular hotel. The attention to detail in the physical as well as the service sets this hotel apart. Comfortably appointed rooms, sumptuous bedding, spa like bathrooms.  Everything is thought of. Gold level is well worth the price, the lounge is amazing. We must return again and again."
ChIJ1fHep5l0j1QRv32d9UTVXLo,Inn at Laurel Point,4.4,48.4234676,-123.3763618,1719,"Absolutely amazing hotel. The rooms are clean, bright, and spacious. We had a room with an unbeatable view of the harbor - we even got to see a heron frequent the shellfish beds in front of the hotel! Staff was excellent and made our stay great, and were so helpful when we forgot something in the room after checking out. The restaurant was delicious and we were always able to quickly get a table. They had AC and the windows were soundproofed well, so the harbor noise didn't wake us. We got a package deal for the gardens, which came with breakfast and free parking. I'm so glad we chose to stay here! We'll definitely be back.The room was really clean,nice furnishing, cute little deck. I had a great view of the ocean. I was there for meetings and the food was great. Especially the trout and desserts. It was easy to find (a taxi got me there) but it was a short walk to Fisherman's Wharf and there were lots of restaurants nearby. The staff were excellent, efficient and friendly. Definitely recommend .Well this was a one night stay at this hotel. When i checked in and went to the room, there was a  vacuum blocking the door (Strange that the cleaners/maids would leave that there). There was nothing special about this room. Especially for the price they were charging. The bathroom had an old 1970s bathtub (only 6"" deep) and a shower head that was too low. The shampoo and such things were bolted to the wall, and it was cheap shampoos. The air conditioning/heating unit was old and loud, something you might again find in a 1970s hotel. I have stayed at high-end hotels all over the world, and I was extremely disappointed by this hotel. There is a swimming pool, no hot tub, no steam room, no sauna. The website said it was open till 12 midnight, but when I arrived to go for a swim at 11pm, it was closed, and the sign on the door said closed at 10pm. The exercise room was small, I wanted to go for a run in the morning only to find there was no treadmill ???.
Before I checked in, I went to the restaurant for a bite to eat, disappointing  again. I ordered a $19 burger, didn't come with any sides??? Just a burger.  A small bowl of French fries for an extra $11 ??? My friend had ordered a Pale Ale, and I ordered a Lager.  We both received Pale Ales. Again, for the price they were charging for this hotel, I was expecting something luxurious and satisfying.
I could hear people snoring in the next room and had a terrible sleep.
I was extremely disappointed. I would never stay here again, and I would highly recommend anyone else to do more research before staying here.
The only thing that was good was the location. Otherwise, this hotel reminded me of a Motel 6 ($40/night). I paid over $500 for 1 night. I did mention  something to the front desk, only to get a response ""Oh thats too bad"", ""thank you for staying with us"".Good location with ocean view, the most overpriced for traditional room, poor amenities, and food. Service is not to satisfy and delight customers. Paid $1000 for 1 room, 2 double beds, 2 nights, not worth money and time. The weather is great thoughWe had a sumptuous gastronomic experience at the Inn's Aura Restaurant. We ordered the crispy pork banh mi and The Point burger, and they were absolutely delicious for the price of $18 and $20 respectively. And the view from the restaurant is just spectacular! Small amphibian planes touching the water and yachts are just a few of the eye candies! They have a gorgeous garden too! It's a short walking distance from the nearest bus stop--Superior at Montreal"
ChIJhUPlSpB0j1QRxJjaswWX1NA,Chateau Victoria Hotel & Suites,4.4,48.42210559999999,-123.3644953,1140,"Our family of four absolutely loved this hotel! Everyone on staff was extremely friendly and helpful and made us feel totally welcome. The pool and jacuzzi were perfect for our young boys. The interiors were gorgeous, the room was beautiful, the beds were super comfortable and our view of Victoria was lovely. We LOVED having breakfast at the restaurant on top - fantastic city views, excellent food and very reasonable prices. My boys also loved the Lego model of the hotel in the lobby - incredibly detailed! Location was perfect and convenient to everything downtown (we walked there from the ferry). I travel a lot for work and usually stay at ""nice"" chain business hotels. This hotel is several cuts above the typical chain hotel in terms of charm, hospitality and comfort. We will make this a home base any time we come back to Victoria!Absolutely fantastic!! The front staff were super nice and helpful, the room was spacious and I loved the set up they had with the two rooms, and the shower has to be the best shower in any hotel I‚Äôve ever used.  I‚Äôm talking great water pressure and not those high pressure jets that eventually feel like they‚Äôre cutting into you, this shower was the perfect was to start my day.

The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and blankets.  The little kitchen was also very nice.

A great stay at a really good rate. :)We visited Victoria to take in a concert at the Capital Ballroom, and chose the Chateau Victoria due to location and price. We definitely weren't disappointed. We only planned on staying one night, but we liked the hotel and the room (Deluxe Queen with bedroom and kitchen, Room 510) so much, that we decided to stay for three nights instead. This gave us a chance to explore Victoria and the surrounding area. The only complaints we have, is that the bed, although comfortable, was outdated and extremely squeaky. Every time I moved, the bed squeaked so badly that my wife woke up, and vice versa. My biggest complaint, however, is that there is a portable air conditioner in the bedroom that is used for the entire hotel room. The compressor on the unit is so incredibly LOUD that every time it kicked in or turned off, we woke up during the night. It was impossible for us to sleep while running the air conditioner and it couldn't be moved to the living room as it was permanently attached to the wall via the air vent. Often, in the middle of the night we had to wake up and turn off the air conditioner, open the window, and turn on the fan just to fall asleep. Therefore, in the 3 days we were at the hotel, we never had a good night's sleep because of the squeaky bed and the air conditioner. Great hotel, great service, great staff, absolutely loved it, but got zero sleep due to the noise of the bed and the air conditioner compressor. 5 stars for the hotel, 1 star for the bed and A/C. 3 stars overall based upon our lack of sleep.Awesome experience. We got an amazing room with two queen beds (one inside the bedroom), a living area with a kitchenette and two TVs, win win for us and the kids :) The room had every amenity I could think of and I love, like a microwave, toaster, coffee maker and kettle so that you could take care of your own meals, a dining table, lots of closet space, clean and huge bathroom space with luxurious toiletries. The breakfast in the roof top restaurant Vista 18 was oh so good!!!! They gave us early check in as well as a late check out. The entire experience was positive. And the location is the icing on the cake, right in the downtown! Highly recommend :)I have now stayed at Chateau Victoria for 2  long term stays during the winter months in 2022 and 2023. This hotel is magnificent. The staff is always cheerful and any request made is followed up almost immediately..their suites come with a full kitchen,living room and separate bedroom. The location is perfect for accessing the waterfront,restaurants or the bus system which will take you anywhere. The hotel offers a free shuttle to local places. The pool and the on-site restaurant Vista 18 are excellent. I always felt important and a valued quest. Highly recommend this place."
ChIJl3vtd5d0j1QRhelqagYmZ9M,Best Western Plus Inner Harbour,4.4,48.4208973,-123.3740613,832,"My wife and I stayed here for 3 nights during our recent BC trip.  We were fortunate to get a large end room on an upper floor with two balconies. The room was bright, comfortable and quiet. The staff was friendly and accommodating.  The included hot breakfast was good and the location was excellent for sightseeing in Victoria.It was a comfortable & excellent stay in the convenient/ best located hotel at central pier. Rooms are big, hygienic with amenities like sofa cum bed, microwave, fridge, cooking range, tea/coffee making m/c with two accessible balconies. The breakfast was nice & tasty. In lobby, complimentary Coffee making machine & drinking water facilities are praise worthy. The Gentleman at reception was very courteous. Looking to come back again next time in Victoria. Keep it up ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶The view on the harbor side is amazing! There was a staff member in training who didn't look at me during my check-in. They did not smile or seem at all like a front desk staff. They like their cell phone though lol.
They forgot to activate my room keys, and it was annoying, I ran from the parking garage back to the front desk and back again after a really long travel day. üòë
The rooms are clean. There were not a lot of amenities in the room. There is no air conditioning in any room. In the summer, it would probably be unbearable.
The hot tub was lovely, as well as the sauna. The fitness room is small but acceptable.  The ""free"" breakfast is not good unless you love salt. That is all everything tasted like. The beds were on the firm side, and I slept well. The total for our 1 night stay, including the $12 for parking ( rip off), was $242 in January. Parking should be included the underground parking is in the hotel!The location is fabulous but the Penthouse suite we were in was rundown and rather tacky. The 1√ó6 lumber on the deck is in terrible condition; the deck chairs are also in bad shape (one had a large tear in the seat, another had green growth on it!).In the kitchen, one of the lower cupboard doors was off its hinge; one of the wine glasses in the cuboard was cracked. As for service, we asked for extra face cloths which were not delivered, one of the shower body wash dispensers was empty. The front desk staff were friendly. Parking below was great. In conclusion, for a suite with such a view and such potential it could sure use an overhaul, especially for the rates charged!!!I took my common law wife for an overnight stay to celebrate our 20 year anniversary and we were treated like Royalty!! The Staff were exceptionally professional and truly kind!! The manager Rachel Dickenson is Absolutely Amazing!! She made our Anniversary one to Remember."
ChIJAf6uFpt0j1QRPMQSNUJ83p8,Victoria Regent Waterfront Hotel & Suites,4.6,48.4265602,-123.3708851,424,"Absolutely beautiful suites. A 2 bedroom king suite is 1200 square feet with incredible views. You wont be disappointed. We did however receive a noise complaint at 11pm on a friday night (2 of us talking in our balcony) but otherwise no complaints. Perfectly situated and walking distance to amazing food and drinks too.We stayed 5 nights in an upgraded 1 BR King, 5th floor suite with great view of BC Legislative Assembly. We appreciated the room fans, screened French patio doors, secure parking spot, Water taxi (pickle boat) dock, daily cleaning and friendly service.  Special thanks to Paras for his helpfulness.Booked a very special Milestone Birthday for my wife this May and keyed in on the location of this Hotel. Although a little dated, it has been well renovated, is very bright and very clean. I booked a package through Expedia (Air, Hotel, Car Rental, etc) then went directly to the Property to upgrade. Staff were fantastic and did everything to make sure this was a very special occasion. The upgrade was inexpensive but what was delivered can only be described as outrageous! Full  1bdrm Penthouse Suite with over 500sqft of Patio over looking the Harbour. Full Kitchen, Full size living room, 4pce bath plus jetted tub and an outdoor enclosed gazebo with 2 sided fireplace into a full size living room. We walked just about everywhere and did a couple water tours (Victoria Harbour Ferry) plus the Butchart Gardens. One of our favourite places to eat was JR Slims, right across the street from Main entrance. The best Nachos were
through the basement on the water side in Lido Waterfront. The Red Fish Blue Fish had huge lineups so if you are walking around early in the day go hungry and go early. This was an Incredible trip and an incredible property. Major brownie points with the missus.Great location for a walkable stay in downtown.  On site parking.  Rooms were well sized and the balcony was a nice plus for evening sitting a people watching.Loved the location! Comfy beds. I appreciated that their toiletry items were both high end and eco-friendly. Staff friendly and accommodating. Will stay again."

Do wish the hotel guests didn't have to walk around to the front entrance of the pubTheir price is good for victoria in that prime location. I stayed on the 3rd floor, and the room was spacious and clean. They don't have any air conditioning or fancy furniture in the room. They provided enough tower fans, the weather was chilling and raining, so it didn't bother us. But there was no hot water, it was really frustrating. We complained multiple times, but they couldn't fix it or switch us to different rooms. Our concern was left unattended. This is not how a guest should feel. All we need after a long day of sight seeing is to relax in a hot tub or a pool. This hotel doesn't have a pool, but they should at least provide hot water for us to shower and relax.The hotel is cool in that it has quite a bit of history but the room had a noticeable smell that is common in older buildings. Opening the windows helped. Great location, easy access to lots of great places in the area.The location is wonderful and we had a one bedroom suite which was very large. It was comfortable temperature wise and the bed was comfortable as well. I enjoyed how convenient to some great food options. Only minuses were the shower and and that the Chromecast didn't work in the living room.This is a very late review from about 2016. We stayed here for Christmas weekend and got I think one of the 2 bedroom suites. First off the service here is very friendly and efficient. You get free coupons for drinks from the bar connected to it. The rooms/suites are nice,cozy and homey. Has everything you need. The location is pretty much in the heart of Victoria so everything is easy access. I can't remember how the parking situation was. The pricing is also very fair. My family and I loved our stay here and will definitely stay here again. It's not your typical hotel, it's more boutique and unique."

The location is fantastic, right next to the beach and only a short walk through a beautiful park to downtown.
The staff were absolutely incredible and even gave us a little tour of all the empty rooms.
Speaking of rooms. OMG. We stayed in the Somerset room which had a balcony, an amazing and huge bathroom with a lounge tub, which was so nice to use after a long day.
The complimentary breakfast was so delicious and had a great view of the ocean and a dog park. Does it get any better than that??
Oh, and I can't forget how beautiful and well maintained the garden was! As well as lots of parking provided, although we chose to park our large truck beside Beacon Hill Park across the street which was still no charge.
If you've read this far, you can probably tell I'm absolutely going to be staying here every chance I get!Honestly one of the best experiences we've ever had!!! The location is amazing!!! We were on the main floor and had a spectacular view!! The rooms are clean and so quaintly decorated; definitely matches the vibe of the house. Literally at the bottom end of Beacon Hill Park, a few short minutes to downtown, so convenient, with great people watching!
The breakfast was soooo goood and the room they serve you in is bright, cozy and comes with the wonderful view I already mentioned!!! Honestly, both days we were there, the service and the food were honestly 11 out 10!!! Could not ask for a better experience!!! The staff are super sweet and friendly and go out of their way to make you happy. If I could give more than 5 stars, I would!! Thank you so much for your hospitality and the little breakfast package of that yummy yogurt to go!!! If we ever come back this way, we'd definitely stay there again! :)Wow! Just wow! We just finished our long weekend trip here for our 10 year anniversary. The staff was beyond sweet and helpful. The ‚ÄúRomance Package‚Äù was such a sweet surprise. I so appreciated them accommodating my food allergies‚Ä¶it was like having a personal chef. Thank you so much! It was hard to leave and we can‚Äôt wait to come back!Super great experience! very beautiful house and tasty breakfast. close to the beach and park, I'm very happy with one stay and gonna book again if visit Victoria next time.The most adorable bed and breakfast located right on the water.

We were able to see the Victoria Day Parade from our room! Only disadvantage is you car hear traffic sound at night, if you are sensitive then book a room that doesn‚Äôt face the Main Street!Stayed here for two nights recently and found the location fantastic in downtown Victoria, the staff insanely lovey and helpful and the room cozy.  Bed was super comfy and the pillow were nice and solid, not like the ones that just sink right through when you lay down.  It was perfect for someone with acid reflux who needs to prop myself up from time to time. Had two great night‚Äôs sleep and didn‚Äôt find it loud (was on the third level).

Parking can be tricky, sure, but the staff were great at providing directions.

Thank you Hotel Rialto!Excellent hotel right in the heart of downtown Victoria. Hotel was clean, had a neat restaurant/bar, bed was very comfy and bathroom floor was heated! Mai was very helpful checking me in and out....well I don't think she was checking me out (haha). Nonetheless, it was a great location that is walkable to literally everything you need or want. Will be staying here next time I'm in Victoria.Overall it was lovely but it would have been nice to see anything other than another persons window outside ours. Can‚Äôt win em all and we booked for location over a view so I won‚Äôt even minus a star for that. Free coffee in the morning was much appreciated and loved being close to Chinatown and Fan Tan Alley.Loudest hotel I‚Äôve ever stayed at. Room 103. You feel like you are sleeping on the street, especially when the busses go by. If you are a light sleeper, do not stay here.

Also, the thermostat in my room did not work so I could not control the temperature. The outlet I plugged my phone into didn‚Äôt work. Luckily the traffic noise woke me up at 4am and I realized my phone was almost dead so I plugged it into a different outlet. And the parking situation is not ideal- the parkade is across a busy street rather than being attached to the hotel. I will never stay here again."

The prices were fair here and the views of the marina were an added bonus. It was a seamless process from check-in to check-out and I would certainly return. It was great to have the use of their pool, whirl pool, sauna and gym too. They offer a free shuttle and the driver is super friendly. The only reason I haven‚Äôt given 5 stars is because the building and rooms are a bit dated and could use a refresh in the future. But in terms of cleanliness, price and location - no complaints at all.great weekend in Victoria - this is by far the best hotel we've stayed in for the price in Vic. Location is perfect, the staff at the front is amazing and the restaurant (Blue Crab) is great. Really clean rooms and spacious for all of our gear we were travelling with. Can't believe the price we got for it - honestly better than we expected! We loved the warm pool and hot tub too. We're staying here again when we visit and we recommend you do too!Great service! My room had a beautiful view. The bidet toilets were amazing! I didn‚Äôt use the pool but it looked amazing. The hot tub was great. One of the treadmills was out of order but I was in the gym alone and used the other one. All the equipment looked fine. The restaurant was great but slightly pricey. They have a driver that can take you downtown Victoria, which is such a plus. There is also this famous neighborhood cat that hangs out in the lobby. So cute! I will definitely book here when I come back to Vic.My first visit to Coast Victoria Hotel and Marina.
Love the location! Close to the Wharf, has a shuttle to downtown and plenty of restaurants close enough.
Beautiful boardwalk along the harbour. Watched the sea buses scoot around the harbour, it's also the seaplane's landing strip as well as the ferry from Seattle comes into the harbour.
This hotel is dog friendly plus has rooms that have had no pets in, for those with allergies!
Great restaurant and bar here as well.
Extensive menu for all meal times.
They have free parking for overnight guests.
Not far from the Parliment Building and BC Royal Museum.
I would definitely stay here again!Great location, beautiful clean indoor / outdoor swimming pool which our grandson loved! The concierge provided us with rides to and from our downtown restaurant. Lovely spot to walk to downtown as well as the fisherman's wharf.  great view of the inner harbour. Staff very friendly and helpful. We will be back!"

Maybe a minibar selection? There wasn‚Äôt even a bottled water in our fridge
But I loved the complementary breakfast
Nice staff
Maybe one little push can make this hotel a 4 star one
Attention to details.
One last thing
For security, it‚Äôs better to have card reader panel in the elevator, anyone can walk in and access levels( scary üòü isn‚Äôt it?)
Nice economy hotel overall.Nice place for the whole family with Parliament just next door.
Wish I had this hotel/experience during the bulk of my vacations. Clean room that comes with a mini kitchen that even has pots/pans (even though I'm not comfortable using public things it's still great to see it's available). Slightly narrow room but nothing to complain about.
Serious props to all the staff and the head chef I believe watching the food area. Amazing breakfast (probably the best breakfast I had in a hotel so far that isn't 4-5 stars), accommodating and polite staff at the desk, and awesome free hot chocolate at the machine. No complaints during my stay.We have stayed at several downtown Victoria hotels over the years but this was our first time at Embassy Inn and will not be our last. We were impressed with the quality of the rooms, pleasant staff, and overall experience. We love the location, and highly impressed with the garden and lawn landscaping in front area.

Breakfast was very good, included mixed berry parfait, muffin, eggs benedict and tea/coffee.We come every 6 weeks or so. The staff are always helpful, breakfast is exceptional, the rooms are quirky, unique and comfortable. Very soft sheets. Always clean :)Two night stay. Both days had the best breakfast served in the stately dining room. Comfortable beds and so quite you will think you are staying here alone. I have already and will continue to share the amazing b&b.Please forgive me, but I can't remember the gentleman's name who greeted us, but either way, be was so great!

Extremely friendly, and welcoming, our stay started off amazing because of him.

We stayed in the Duchess suite and absolutely loved how old it was. The only complaint is that the bathroom curtains are dated and town, and rhe mattress is extremely hard. Perhaps upgrading the mattresses in the room would make it that much more amazing.

We enjoyed the jetted tub, and especially the delicious breakfast the next morning. The whole Inn is had such a lovely Victorian feel to it.

The walk to downtown was about 3km but it sits a few seconds away from the bus stop and every bus rakes you downtown. $5.00 for a day pass.I visited here for my vacation and it was absolutely amazing. I got the garden room and I'm so glad I did. The room as an outside entrance which makes it perfect if you come back late or want to leave early without disturbing to many people or if you just want to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the fresh air. The breakfast was perfect and I loved the decor of the whole place. Gave it a more welcoming feel than a traditional hotel. The staff members were also extremely friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend staying here. I know I will the next time I come up."

The staff was very eager to please and did everything to make our stay memorable. Our room had a fire place and a jacuzzi tub with all the comforts including a bottle of champagne. The breakfasts were incredible! So much care and thought went into it and it was beautifully presented. They even went out of their way to cater to our dietary preferences. Five star breakfasts!!
It is an older home and some things need to be updated and fixed, but overall it‚Äôs very charming. The location is ideal, walking distance from downtown and the Village.We spent nine nights at the Beaconsfield in. The room was very spacious. Our host upgraded us to a larger room as the room was not being used. The staff was very friendly and most accommodating. The Inn is very centrally located and is a short walk to the ocean or to downtown. The breakfasts are first class and the afternoon wine and snacks in the library room were a pleasant surprise. We will definitely be back next time we visit family in VictoriaI can't say enough wonderful things about this Inn. The decor was like something out of a movie or magazine and the staff were so nice and attentive. We stayed in the Emily Carr room, which is highly recommended. We were served incredible breakfast both mornings we were there. This is our home away from home whilst in Victoria. 6/5 stars if I could!This is such a nice place to spend a romantic weekend.  We stayed in the Emily Carr room, which has a jacuzzi tub and a wood burning fireplace in the same room.  It's decorated in deep rich colours and has books about/by Emily Carr to read as you relax on the chaise lounge.
The library downstairs is stocked with snacks, wine, and board games to encourage guests to hang out and socialise with each other if they like.  It's a really cool way to meet other couples who are on their own romantic adventure.We loved this quaint little (family run?) place. Sincere people, nice rooms. We went on our anniversary and they asked if we wanted to be bumped us up to a larger suite room. Nice breakfast and variety for food.

Our room was spotless and had some extra unexpected touches like complimentary slippers and bottled water. The beds and room furniture was also fantastic and comfortable! The breakfast buffet is also not be missed, they had everything you could need (quick oats, cereal, hot baked goods, coffee machine with alternate hot drink options like hot chocolate and lattes, and fresh fruit). Definitely recommend and will be staying here again in the future!We just finished a 30 day long term stay at Robin Hood and it was a very pleasurable experience. The staff are very helpful and supportive. Sam is particularly welcoming.
The Great room with its amenities is fun and we especially enjoyed the complimentary breakfast (special thanks to Vivian and Darren).
The location is great, so close to wonderful walks along the Gorge. We used the e-bikes several times and it was so easy to get to the galloping goose trail.
The rooms are spotless, the beds comfy and the toiletries are top quality.Great hotel to stay in! Went to Victoria in early spring exactly during the cherry blossom season and enjoyed our stay in the hotel surrounded by flowering trees. The location is pretty good as well, you can walk to the downtown for just 30 min, enjoying the views of the harbour! The shuttle delivered us from the airport directly to the hotel, which was really nice. The staff was always very helpful and friendly (even when I had trouble dealing with laundry, but in the end it worked perfectly!). Complimentary breakfasts made a very good start for the day with delicious fresh pastries, yogurt and variety of choices for tea/coffee. The great room has a billiard, table soccer and many board games, which is a good thing to play in the rainy evening. Separate appreciation to the complimentary e-bikes, we really enjoyed cycling up to Mount Douglas Park (highly recommended to visit).I had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast at this establishment, and I must say, the selection of bread and fruit was delightful. The array of choices available ensured that there was something to please every palate.

One aspect that truly stood out to me was the exceptional service provided by Vivian, Sian, and Darren. Their kindness and warm smiles created a welcoming atmosphere that made my breakfast experience even more enjoyable. It's clear that the staff takes pride in their work and genuinely cares about the satisfaction of their guests.

Overall, I highly recommend this place for a satisfying stay experience. From the delicious food options to the outstanding service, it's a delightful way to start the day.Stayed here a few times, once for a longer term during the pandemic. The suites are super clean, the staff is so nice and the cleaning ladies are very cool. For a motel this is 5 stars for sure. I like the addition of the free slippers the last time I stayed overnight when my ferry got cancelled. Lots of parking even for larger vehicles. Highly recommend."

I thought wrong! am voluntarily writing this review out of good will and because the hotel is wonderful. We just got back from staying at Four Seasons in Whistler and I can actually say that his hotel is even more comfortable than Four Seasons. It‚Äôs clean, rooms are big and comfortable, location is great and most of all, the staff are all genuinely nice. This must come from management so I can‚Äôt say enough good things for how this hotel is being managed. Love everything about it and so happy to be here. Five starts for sure!!! I will be recommending this place to anyone who is interested in coming to visit Victoria. The bar downstairs is also so lively! We have an eight year old with us and we all had a great experience with the staff for after dinner drinks.This hotel is incredibly nice and all the staff give excellent service. We stayed on the top floor; the room was boujee and every touch luxurious. The bed was really comfortable; a firm mattress but the kind your body thanks your for. We both slept like babies even though I have a hard time sleeping in most hotel beds.
I highly recommend staying here. The spa is also amazing and the restaurant has top notch food and cocktails (and of course incredible service).Great place to stay in Victoria! Friendly staff, highly clean rooms and fancy toiletries! Bath robe is worth having, should have bought it. Very convenient location to walk around the town, places to visit. And they have a charging station for electric vehicles. I used paid valet parking.I cannot say enough good things about The Magnolia Hotel! I am a bit of a germaphobe and our room was extremely clean, spacious, quiet, and well-equipped (fluffy robes, Dyson brand hair dryer and all attachments, L'Occitane toiletries). The staff is exceptionally friendly and hospitable. The location is perfect, with most everywhere we wanted to see/visit/dine at within walking distance. The staff cleaned our room each day as a rule and provided fresh towels and face cloths more than once per day if we required, without us ever needing to ask. The nightly turn-down service with chocolates was such a lovely touch! We had our young daughter with us and she was treated with the utmost respect. This hotel provided excellent value and I would 100% recommend it over other luxury hotel brands.We had a great stay at the Magnolia this weekend.  From the valet to the front desk to the housekeepers to the restaurant, the service was excellent - very personable and attentive.  Recently stayed at a Fairmont in Vancouver and the service was sub-par compared to the experience at the Magnolia.  Will be our hotel of choice when visiting Victoria in the future.  Thank you for a wonderful experience!"

We have stayed in many places, but this was our first time at the Oswego. We loved our stay. Everything was spotless. The kitchen was a good size as well as the whole suite. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was perfect for us. Lots of room well appointed. Front desk staff were excellent also and the location is superb. We will definitely be back we loved our stay.The only best thing out of our recent Victoria trip was Oswego. The employees were super friendly our room was clean! Had a nice smell coming in, fans on (hot sunny day it was) with music playing, a personalized welcome card with our family name and one for our dog. We were staying at the 2 bed boutique suite and the view was amazing ! Had a lot of slide doors leading to a huge patio. Kept the space very bright and breezy with fresh air flowing in and out. The only downside was that I think there was a wind storm.. it got really chilly so we couldn‚Äôt eat out on the patio table. Wish the beds were a bit bigger, at least Queen sized for a family of 4 to stay. But otherwise, definitely coming back !After searching many places to stay for our short one day/night in Victoria, I was very pleased with our choice. We wanted to check out the city in a few short hours and managed to get a lot in within walking distance of our hotel. We stayed in a studio suite, which is equivalent to a large regular hotel room with a huge bathroom and kitchenette. We asked for a playpen for our toddler, and was all set up with linens prior to our arrival. Easy check in/out as well as underground secured parking. Very happy with our choice!Great location, just off the main harbour, short walk to everything. Large rooms with lots of features. Loved having a balcony. Staff were all very friendly. It was nice there was electric vehicle parking for free, charging rates were fair. Elevators were slow. Some items in the kitchen and desk were very dusty. Room was hot as there was no A/C, but it was exceptionally hot.Location is easy for walking to many sights. Suites are comfortable and clean. Housekeeping gave us any extras we needed. Elevators are a bit slow. Carpets weren't that clean for our baby to sit on but that's probably how a lot of hotel carpets are."
ChIJMyP4Fph0j1QRV1v5hj5TcxE,Haterleigh Heritage Inn,4.0,48.4209486,-123.3773558,21,"I recently had the opportunity to stay at this Inn that can only be described by me as quaint and eclectic. It was kind of like what if you stayed in a home during the Downton Abbey or Murdoch Mysteries era, and some modern conveniences were Jerry rigged within. The rooms literally felt like a time machine into the 1800s complete with the old style solid metal skeleton keys, and there were an odd appearance of modern items here and there. The hosts, a Chinese family, are very welcoming, friendly and strive to make the guests as comforting as possible. Their breakfast room is incredibly generous, with snacks and even entire meals (in a freezer available) available at all times with tons of beverages both hot and cold also available. Honestly, I like the place, and while I never used the jacuzzi in my room, they even made all the possible oils and refreshing lotions (and actually fairly high end stuff) available too. Most importantly,  this place is incredibly well situated, being literally minutes walking time from the Fisherman's Wharf, the Royal BC Museum, Chinatown, the government buildings and do on. It's also walking distance to a supermarket and a few convenience stores as well.Gorgeous place and generous/thoughtful host!
7:00 to all day breakfast hour - Great hot breakfast and some Asian selections. Will visit again :))Generally good but we had problems with our toilet in the Kingston suite. In general the bathroom wasn't particularly clean. UV disinfecting was a nice feature, but lights and electrical looked a bit dodgy. Great location however!Great place to stay in Victoria. Very convenient to ferry and downtown, but on a quiet residential street. Tasty wholesome breakfast.Beautiful house with a wonderful host! The breakfasts were incredible! This house is also walking distance to everything, and has free parking. I will definitely be back!"

I have lived here for the past 8 months because the person and people here have given me refuge. I have been fortunate enough to live in a society where people like the ones I have lived with understand what it means to have a roof unto ones head. The owner of this establishment gives to others in need. During the summer months it becomes necessary for economic reasons to evacuate those that don't have the means. We understand. During the rest of the year, those in need can still find refuge. Thank you.Bless him the manager did his best. But he could do with a clean shirt perhaps.it was not quite a salubrious as expected but it was a bed and bathroom for the night with parking. Room was large X2 queen beds  with kitchenette and AC.Nice Inn keeper. Provides breakfast everyday. Long term residence are very nice. Rooms also come with kitchens, so you can cook, dishes, pans and cutlery provided, as well as fridge and complimentary coffee in your room with machineI'm really happy about this place. The owner was  nice and friendly. The room was big, comfortable, and the location was goodIt is a very old hotel which the owner is trying to update. And doing a good job. First impressions from the outside some might think ' what a dive ' . Please don't judge from the outside. HUGE ROOMS some with kitchens with full size fridge microwaves etc. Other rooms still huge with microwave coffee machine and mini fridges for now. Very clean beds very comfortable. Great pillows...black out curtains but need some new ones. For smokers or not patio tables with w chairs outside your door. Owners are extremely nice. Parking lot exceotionallt well lit.

ChIJIZHX2r90j1QRqeJIblP72fg,Ocean Island Suites,4.3,48.41309700000001,-123.3705996,6,"I'm giving OI Suites a 5 star review because the service, price and location could not be beat.  Located amongst the beautiful heritage houses of James Bay, only a couple blocks from Beacon Hill Park, Dallas Road and the beach, a quick 12 minute walk to downtown Victoria and a 10 minute walk from all major bus routes.  There is off-street parking for 3 on a first come first serve basis and parking was never an issue.  The back yard, deck and garden were beautiful.  It's dog friendly and they didn't think twice about taking my 40 kg dog and I for a months stay.  Keo and Niko were extremely accommodating and anytime I needed anything, they responded almost immediately and provided it asap.  The suite is located in an old heritage house so expect the quirks and slight wear and tear of an older house but that is 100% part of it's charm.  My large fully furnished suite was way cheaper and quieter than a tiny hotel room, the bed was super comfortable and clean, check-in was extremely easy and communication was top notch prior to and during my stay.  Would not hesitate to stay there again!Fantastic furnished suite in a historic house. Quiet neighborhood within walking distance of Everything you would need or want to see!  Staff is extremely responsive and friendly. Stay here if you want a hassle free visit in Victoria!Quite a good place to stay. Appreciated a bunch of things like the claw foot tub, ice in the freezer, and spacious rooms. Kept seeing hair and dust balls in the bedroom. Bent down and looked under the bed. Clearly been too long since that area was properly cleaned. Had a general experience that the suite could have been cleaner (had to wipe the dust off the leather chairs before my friend and I could sit...). Not much of a sound barrier between suites 2 and 3 in the back if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise grateful to have discovered these accommodations.- They changed the cost of the room,,,
- They tried to charge me for the transfer from the reservation point to the suite (8 minutes by car)
- Only speak English"
ChIJnbDTGAJ1j1QRf6MPOCi_M7k,Pendray Inn and Tea House,4.4,48.4217781,-123.375213,512,"I love afternoon tea and Pendray Inn and tea house was a great experience. I loved the house and the history of the place. The interior construction and design is so beautiful. The tea selection and service was excellent. The food was very good and the scones tasted so crunchy buttery and soft on the inside. I gave a 4 star rating for 2 reasons. Our table and the food. Our table was tiny and we were stuffed into a corner. I felt so crowded at the table and like we were placed there as an afterthought. The food for the most part was delicious but I felt like the 2 scones was a lot, I wanted more from the savories, and the desserts were pretty basic. There was a smoked salmon and capers pinwheel which was barely 2 small bites, I could have had another. The crab cake was tiny and so was the chicken salad puff. This was still a lovely experience and the food was very good. I would recommend it.Wonderful afternoon tea in a historical building.  The scones are amazingly fluffy and a great selection of teas.  Service was impeccable and quality of food was excellent.

Only reason atmosphere was not 5/5 is because it can get noisy in there once it fills up.  Nothing else is wrong!Visited this quaint yet beautiful teahouse close to the harbour. Had a wonderful high tea experience with my family. Not only did they have vegetarian options, they also give the option of vegan high tea! Their tea was great and tea time offerings were delicious. Service was impeccable and all staff were extremely polite. Highly recommended!We came to afternoon tea to celebrate my husband's birthday. The presentation was beautiful, and it was wonderful that there was a vegetarian offering as well. We had a window seat...but the reason I'm giving this a four instead of a five star review is because there was a large bird dropping smear on it. It seems this could be taken care of, as there are various people doing things in the garden. When we walked by a couple of days later, it was still there.Super disappointed.  I will not go back.  This was a first-time tea experience for my family.  We had a reservation.  We were seated on time but a guest with a later reservation (and without their remaining party‚Äôs arrival) was served first.
Our orders were mixed up and they had to take things back.  Because of how they plated things(based on how we were seated my daughters who are 8 and 11 would have to reach across the table, while on their knees or standing to get food.  One of my daughters and I had to change seats so that she could reach her food.  I ordered no seafood, and all of the seafood was placed in front of me.   For a $200 tea, I expected thoughtfulness and attention to detail."

We recommended going to the Old English and Anne Hathaway's cottage...I'm devastated it's closed for now. I truly hope you reopen soon!! Wonderful memories we had and we stayed in the Juliet room!! Come back!!!!The staff was very friendly - so hospitable!!!  Nice little lounge where we played Scrabble (provided by the inn).  Room was clean and we had a beautiful private rooftop deck.  The only room for improvement in my opinion is a new mattress and pillows would make sleeping more comfortable.  Excellent stay!If you can imagine a page out of an old English fairy tale, this is it. If you love old world charm, you will love this place. It's true to its roots... don't expect super modern amenities (for its charm it has plenty of amenities, however!), but expect tons of old world charm. The room was clean, and comfortable. The picturesque building is a marvel to look at! And, close to lots of food, and only minutes from the water.Very nice building on the outside in a good location. Our room however could use some renovation. It looks all a bit dated and the room organization is less than optimal. Furthermore, the door can't be bolted from the inside and the refrigerator was broken. The included breakfast was okay, but nothing special.This hotel has the potential to be great but right now its not - so much so that I don't think the rooms at the top of the hotel should be rented at all.
The floor slopes badly so you are continually fighting to stay in the bed, there is no insulation so the room is unbearably hot and no air conditioning other than a standard fan and open windows.
The bathroom door didn't shut properly, there was a big crack across the hand basin, and the light in the bathroom was inadequate. There was also mold around the shower / bath.
To get to these rooms you need to lug your cases up 4 flights of stairs (the last two being very narrow) as there is no lift.
The emergency exit stairs appear rotten and you feel as if you used them you could become the emergency.
Breakfast is complimentary and there is an acceptable range of food except you wonder about the hygiene practices of the staff when they put out tongs for the guests to use but then put the croissants on the tray with their bare hands.
All in all not somewhere we could recommend unless significant repairs and renovations are made."

Despite the quiet atmosphere, it is within walking distance to downtown Victoria. The lovely Beacon Hill Park is just a stone's throw away from the hotel.
The laid-back inmates and the service of the friendly staff created a very homely atmosphere.
We absolutely loved the complimentary coffee in the morning. The snack machine upstairs and the restaurant and pub downstairs were convenient.
We are eagerly looking forward to our next stay.Lovely boutique-style hotel in a beautiful 112 year old building. Totally not haunted. The architecture and design are very interesting and they use all the space very well. Free ice and cheap vending machines on site. Pub, kitchen, and cafe in the basement.

The king size room we stayed in had a shower with two heads, one on each side. Beautifully furnished with a classical charm that hasn't been the norm for a long time. Absolutely would stay again.This is a quaint, homey place to stay. We were in the cottages. It was a great sleep, clean, and the customer services was fantastic. Thanks for making us feel so welcomed. With the cottages - you‚Äôre in an old house so you‚Äôll occasionally hear others moving around. Didn‚Äôt bother us! Better than the ‚Äúbig chain hotels‚Äù around the city.My husband and I stayed here for one night on Valentines as we were having dinner at the restaurant here. They gave us a very nice corner room on the top floor and we had a nice view. Also there is a balcony on the second and third floors for guests to use and there are chairs and tables out there. We enjoyed sitting out there with a glass of wine before dinner. Beds were comfortable as well. Ice water, coffee and tea are served in the lobby as well.Staff was Absolutely Outstanding! I lost the list but remember 'Roy'. He was full of it, that is local lore, information, advice and a great sense of humor.  Glad he wasn't charging for all the questions we asked. We arrived early but they gladly stored our luggage until check in then held it until our ferry departed. We found the room quiet at night even with the windows open. The sound of the horses/carriages put us to sleep nightly. Except for the Butchart Gardens our entire visit was planned to be by foot which made the location perfect. We will return. Thanks for making our trip memorable and grrreat."
ChIJed_iiJB0j1QRmWAbBm3DCzw,The Union Club of British Columbia,4.5,48.4227645,-123.3673672,219,"The Union Club is a century old plus property steeped in British history and tradition.  It is actually a private club that offers hotel accommodations.  Dare I say, it is something an old boys club with archaic dress codes, and on some evenings men only in the lounge. It does have some great character, history and architecture on the main level, however the room we stayed was disappointing.    To put it bluntly the property looks a bit tired, and we were surprised that some basic amenities were absent the room.  I‚Äôve stayed in other century old properties, however they‚Äôve managed to modernize without losing charm and character.

The pictures on their website made our room seem larger than it was, ours was very small with no a/c and an awful bathroom.  The bathroom had no exhaust fan to vent shower steam requiring guests to open the old windows a crack, not too much as you would provide other guests a show.   Paint was peeling in spots on the bathroom walls likely due to moisture and some patches were painted with a noticeable difference in colour.   The soaps and shampoos provided were motel quality, and the shower stall annoyingly didn‚Äôt have a simple shelf to place soap and shampoos, which required opening and closing the shower door to retrieve them while showering.  This may sound like nit picking however it results in a wet and slippery bathroom floor. The mattress seemed old as it offered little support as one sinks into it, unless super soft is to your liking.

There is no on-site parking which requires guests park their car a couple of blocks away in a parkade, fortunately everything is within walking distance so there is little need to access your car unless leaving the downtown core.  On the bright side the breakfast offered in the downstairs dining room  was excellent as was the service.  We did not have dinner as we decided to dine at nearby restaurants, all within a few minutes walk of the Inn. There is no room service offered, however they will allow you to come downstairs to grab a meal and bring it back to your room. They do have a quaint rooftop terrace where you can view the harbour and enjoy the ocean breeze with a drink and company.  Maybe the larger rooms with sitting area are better, unfortunately none were available for our booking.  I will add it is a quiet night stay.

It is certainly a property connected to the history of Victoria, and I‚Äôm sure if the walls could talk it would have some wonderful stories to tell.  If you want a property filled with history,  some great artwork on its walls, and you are willing to forgo some convenience of a more updated property, then you will likely enjoy it.Went to meet a friend in Victoria this night. What a disappointment. Rude, uncommunicative staff...below average food. I witnessed the bartender emptying a bag of potato chips into a bowl and serving it to a table. This Union Club in Victoria is dead. Old money and stock market spinners. Don't waste your time unless you need to sell yourself.Joined the club in March.
Nice quiet peaceful atmosphere.
Have eaten some awesome dinners. Five star meals and service.Took a tour as we are considering joining the club.

Our tour guide, Danielle, was friendly while being very informative and helpful.

An impressive landmark, with rich heritage... truly beautiful building.  Amenities were nice, and the location is amazing.

Non members can book rooms here, might be a unique place to stay on your next visit to Victoria.I hadn't been in years, but went for dinner tonight to celebrate a friend's birthday. The building is absolutely lovely. The staff were helpful and welcoming from door to table. The dining room service was absolutely excellent. The dinner was delicious. The food was better than I remember. I had the Ceasar salad and for an entree, the salmon, both excellent. The bathrooms are clean and well provisioned. The place is steeped in the elegant history of a bygone era and worth a visit just to stare up at the carved wood paneling and gorgeous vintage glass."
ChIJrUf2npF0j1QRQneQMNnT_SY,The Parkside Hotel & Spa,4.5,48.4204774,-123.3629913,1431,"WARNING: No air-conditioning!

I really liked a lot about this hotel, and I will definitely highlight the pros, but I want to quickly discuss my concerns first. Although I only have two concerns with this property, I believe they are significant.

The first, as mentioned, is that there is no air-conditioning. Now this is not something I even check for in a hotel - it's like colour TV. I was SHOCKED when we got in and I read a note about their environmental initiatives which include no air conditioning. Ten years ago, you would not have needed air condition in Victoria, but that is sadly no longer that case. And I do understand the irony of criticizing this hotel for their carbon positive policies when climate change is the one causing these increased temperatures. I was so glad we were there the week after a heat wave and we were okay. I would return to this hotel, and recommend it to others, only in the months of October to March for this reason.

The second is a safety concern. Because of the lack of AC, they had the windows open in our room upon arrival. Now this is another thing I'm not used to. I pretty much never open windows in a hotel room, and I'm certainly not expecting them to be opened for me. Because of the quiet street, it took me awhile to even notice that they were open. Once I saw the high up windows letting in the fresh air, I thought that seemed nice. What I was alarmed to notice later was the floor-level windows, which were also open in such a way that my eight-month old baby could have easily crawled right out. They knew we had a baby since we requested a crib, and still left these windows open. They were slightly behind the sofa, so I didn't spot them until my son was crawling in their direction, and I was horrified. I'm honestly not sure how that would pass any kind of safety requirements.

Like I said, two significant concerns, but otherwise it is truly a beautiful property. We received EXCELLENT service from everyone we interacted with at the hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The koi pond and lobby are stunning. The cafe/bar on site is delicious. The location is convenient. We happily made use of the washer/dryer (more of a washer than a dryer as with most combo machines) and dishes in our suite. Overall the property feels luxurious for a reasonable price. If you are travelling to Victoria in Oct/Nov/Dec/Jan/Feb/Mar, I would very much recommend The Parkside.Hotel was beautiful!  The suite had everything!  A kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, walk in closet, living room, fireplace, washing machine!  The pool was great, I didn‚Äôt have time for the spa but I wish I did!  Underground parking was convenient although came with an added fee.  I would 100% stay again.  Thank you Parkside Victoria!A-1 friendly staff. The hotel's cafe is really good. Just make sure there is nothing of value in your vehicle when you park in the underground lot. That includes the street the hotel is located. Smash and grab nearly weekly in this particular block of Humboldt. I know this because I've lived next to the hotel for over ten years. Pets are allowed!We did not stop here for a nights sleep but a gingerbread competition that we saw from the street! The inside lobby is very beautiful with open koi ponds and walkways across them. The ceiling is very high and the whole room feels extremely spacious. There is a small coffee shop here in the lobby as well that serves really good coffee! I can only hope that the rooms are just as nice as the bottom!A great place to stay in Victoria. Close to downtown and the waterfront and a quick walk to great restaurants.
The rooms are comfortable and there is a lot of space. The kitchenette was super handy. Bathrooms are a little dated but clean.
The spa was a great way to relax after a busy week of travel."

It even came with a deck and chilled wine glasses! Lots of privacy and small touches to make our visit perfect and memorable. Careen was a great hostess who gave us a very nice breakfast te next morning... after the BEST sleep ever! There was so much to see and do.  Thanks Careen!This was a great b&b experience! We stayed for two nights and found the room comfortable and clean.

The location is great, there are tons of restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf, a water taxi stop, and whale watching tours. It's a bit of a trek to downtown from here but the taxi rides were cheap, and when it wasn't raining we walked and really enjoyed the views along the way.

I would definitely stay here again!Careen was awesome! She is very accommodating with check in and check outs. Luggage drop off and easy check in. The place couldn't be more convenient.  Close to everything or just jump into a water taxi to get to downtown. Bed was so comfortable and quite place to sleep. Price was reasonable.  Aloha and MahaloWe travel to Victoria several times a year and recently decided to treat ourselves to a stay at the Fisherman's Wharf Bed and Breakfast.  We had seen the B&B before and thought it looked cute and now that we have stayed there we can confirm it is cute inside as well!   We stayed in the Poppy room (1 of 2 rentable rooms), and it had delightful elegant poppy d√©cor.  The room was more spacious than we anticipated, the bed was comfortable, everything was clean and well cared for and we felt very welcomed when we arrived.   We were surprised to find that the B&B isn't noisy in the daytime or at night and having our own little balcony over the water was a treat.  There are lots of windows so it is bright inside.  There was some gentle movement from the water (there was a breeze but not a strong wind) but it didn't bother us at all.  We were given a coupon for breakfast at the Imagine Caf√© which serves organic food and offers ' an experiential & transformative learning space designed as an internship business program for young adults, all cultures & all abilities.', which we thought was wonderful.  We both had their French Toast with whipped cream (hey we're on vacation!), which was delicious but we were so tempted by their pastries we bought scones for breakfast the next day.  We really love the way these two business mutually partnered to support each other's local business in such a positive way and it was a real win win for us the guests.  Parking was included in the cost and was easy to find and close by.  Overall it was a great place to stay and we have already posted about it and told many friends because it was a much more enjoyable place to stay than a standard hotel!Stayed here for one night during a vacation out to BC. Wish we had booked many more nights to stay here after the first. The location was amazing, with a water taxi located right outside the door, many places to eat on the wharf, and a whale watching tour (discounted for tenants at the BnB) taking off from the same dock. In one day we had amazing fish&chips, saw whales and took a water taxi for a delicious dinner downtown victoria.

Despite the house being on water, it did not move much, only subtle rocking which wasn't even perceivable to us as most times.

Would highly recommend to anyone visiting the area."

So grateful we had somewhere to stay so close to the hospital! The walk to the hospital is only 10 minutes, which makes frequent shorter visits quite doable. It was also really nice to be able to use the kitchen. I felt very comfortable staying here. Thank you, Heart House!The house was immaculately clean including the cozy front room and kitchen. Covid protocols were followed very well. A tour made us comfortable in the home and allowed us to have food in and served with dishes from our dedicated cupboard. We enjoyed walking around the quaint neighborhood.Such a wonderful place to stay.  The staff are so helpful and caring.  They make the best breakfast to start your day.

I stayed in August of 2017 for 5 days with my 2 children and had a wonderful vacation.  The house was cozy and very clean in a really safe, quiet neighborhood. It had everything from towels to soap to dishes as promised. Denise and Robert were very kind hosts and had prepared all sorts of extra things such as up to date maps and brochures. They had great suggestions of where to visit as well. The house was located within walking distance of downtown, parks, a grocery store, laundromat and coffee shops. It truly was a home away from home.  We will definitely consider this place whenever visit Victoria.This was a great vacation suite for two people, very centrally located to downtown and the Inner Harbour! It is located on a quiet street in James Bay, very safe neighborhood. Robert and Denise met us when we arrived, showed us around and provided instructions for everything. There is also
lots of information about restaurants, shopping and things to do in the suite.

The kitchen was well stocked with all the basics and more. It was nice to relax in the morning and be able to make our own breakfast.

The bathroom though small was functional and our hosts not only provided the usual toilet paper but soap, shampoo and conditioner as well. I suggest bringing a hanging toiletry bag to help with limited counter space.

The queen bed was very comfortable.
Though Victoria was having a hot spell we found the unit to be easily
cooled by opening the windows for a cross breeze and using the fan our hosts provided. I particularly liked the labeling on many items as an explanation for their use.
There was a parking spot in front of the suite which was very much
a plus.
For those who are interested the high speed Internet worked well.
We spent a week at HarbourWalk Suite and would love to return.A wonderful find!  It is a quaint looking1922 cottage with a clematis clad veranda which can be used for relaxing while appreciating the charming homes across the way and the horse drawn carriages touring this historic street.  The area is quiet despite being so close to major roads.

We liked staying here much better than a hotel as we had a full kitchen giving us the option of preparing some of our own meals. Denise and Robert showed attention to the details by providing everything needed including paper towels, tissues, towels, sharp knives, coffee filters, good quality appliances and dishes, a large comfy bed, umbrellas and brochures about attractions and restaurants in Victoria. The unit was very functional and clean!  Perfect for two people.   It is situated within easy walking distance of a  grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants,  a laundromat, and many of Victoria's major attractions.  A small word of warning, you need to be agile to climb into the lovely clawfoot tub/ shower.

Robert and Denise were quick to respond to our email inquires and their quoted prices include all taxes and fees!  Our stay there was June 16-21, 2017.  We highly recommend this unit and plan to return.

Patti M. and Paul C., South Surrey, BCThe Harbourview vacation suite is perfectly located on a lovely, quiet street close to downtown and the ocean. I stayed there by myself and felt very safe. I was able to walk to grocery stores and to coffee shops. I travel a great deal and stay in various vacation rentals and this suite was the cleanest vacation rental I have ever stayed in. So nice!  Thank you Denise and Robert for the stay!
Amy BoughtonSuch a wonderful charming place to stay in Victoria!! This place is a gem and is centrally located making it easy to walk to the many wonderful sites! Staying here puts you close to the walking paths along the water, to Fisherman's Wharf, the Inner Harbour and downtown! There is also a grocery store, pub and coffee shop within a couple blocks.
The suite has everything you need and is super clean. I highly recommend staying here! I hope to be back there myself."

The room was very beautifully decorated, comfortable and clean. The breakfast was the best!!! Eggs Benedict, eggs Florentine and pancakes were all beyond delicious. The staff is so, so friendly and made us feel right at home. The common room is super comfortable and also nicely decorated. Another venue we would liked to stay longer. The location is very convenient, within walking distance to Victoria downtown and very quiet at night.Very nice experience at Marketa's B&B in the honeymoon bedroom! The location is great (downtown 5 min walk from the legislative assembly), the rooms are spacious, the decoration is well chosen, the breakfast is delicious and homemade, and the bed is comfortable. You will feel home. I definitely recommend.Marketa's B&B is charming with character, located in the quiet and lovely James Bay area. The rooms are clean and beds so comfortable! And the breakfast which is included with each stay is sooo delicious! Marketa as well as her staff serving the breakfast in the mornings are all very hospitable! I will be back for sure!It was a great cozy place, just a few steps away from Victoria downtown and many places of interest. Staff was super friendly. The breakfast was included, and it was delicious. Enjoyed our stay very muchGreat food ^^ It was yummy and fresh. Server was very nice. She checked our coffee and juice every 5 mins. The one thing  I don't like was the wall was too thin so I could hear  the other guest's talk."
ChIJK_SitVdzj1QRymkfblwx8ME,Hemingway's By The Sea,4.2,48.4235336,-123.4071907,29,"I was there on my first trip to North America - it was very nice. The owner was German - like me, and she gave us tons of good tips where to go to have a great time. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was solid.This B&B is located in a very quiet area, minutes away from downtown Victoria. Richards is a great host, that takes care of you like your were family.

The rooms are spacious and very clean, but could use a little bit of an upgrade in the recent future (e.g. our bed is a bit squeaky and the mattress quite hard).

Breakfast is great and we got a fresh made omelette, as well as fruits, croissants, cereal, fresh coffee, and more.They Cheat and charge extra money!!

We booked a 2 Queen beds in a apartment that clearly stated 4 adult occupancy. After the booking, within few minutes the owner called and said the room rate is only for 2 adults and she will charge me 120$ extra for the additional two adults, which is outrageous!!

She was Rude and Sarcastic when I mentioned the travel website clearly shows occupancy of 4. I cancelled the Hotel right away within 10 minutes of booking and still she charged me the penalty. She will pay her karma

please STAY FAR AWAY from this hotel.Unfortunately we only stayed one night in this beautiful B&B. We had the ""Serengeti"" and the ""Hemingway"" suite. Both were very lovely and cozy. Charly and Patti are very friendly and have a lot of tips for places to visit. If we come back to Victoria we will definitely book this B&B again!We had a great stay the host are extremely sweet and the room was very clean. It is outside the Victoria hussle so, it was quite. The breakfast was huge and they catered to food allergies."

Separate entrance and keys were provided, along with a private smoking area and delicious daily baked goods made by the host herself. Ultra pleasant and so nice. One of the easiest 5 stars ever.

I thought it was really close to downtown, government street is like a 10 minute walk, maybe less?I had a perfect stay at the Gaslight Inn. The location is convenient, the room was comfortable, and the bathroom was nice. The host is very nice and the process was so easy. I loved the breakfast that was included. Highly recommended!warm welcome and nice breakfast, lovely roomsfar from downtownFriendly but discreet welcome. Nice bedroom with bathroom to share with another bedroom. Breakfast simple but quite correct. Bus stop at 50m."
ChIJe1kxbJ1zj1QRSDvUzrwCqQk,Mayfair Motel,3.9,48.44659859999999,-123.3724796,95,"The room we stayed at was a lot larger than we thought. It also came fully supplied from amenities such as soap and towels to a fridge and keurig machine. We are really happy with the service and the place exceeded our expectations. The front desk lady, assumed to be the owner, was friendly and also directed our attention to events and attractions happening that weekend. She was extremely helpful and welcoming. I highly recommend this place.We were pleasantly surprised by our experience here. A simple motel that was very clean, with friendly staff, and rooms bigger than expected. Overall, we liked it a lot. The only downside would be the lack of air conditioning - we stayed in June and it was still warm in our room. If it had been any hotter, we would have looked somewhere else.Very easy to access from transit and only 8 min bus ride from downtown Victoria. Reception staff was super friendly and helpful giving us a map and sightseeing suggestions. The room was more spacious than expected with a small kitchen table, microwave, fridge, sofa, TV, 2 closets, mirrors, washroom and 2 queen beds. Ideal for multiple people and longer stays.The may be the cleanest motel I have ever stayed at.  The staff are friendly and accommodating.

Excellent value for the rate and located near many amenities.

I liked to walk downtown (20 min) but there are buses that pass by every few minutes as well if you are not driving.We were very impressed with the size of the rooms. They were huge! And very clean with comfy bedding. For the price we paid, we consider this a hidden gem. It is near a Starbucks, Tim Hortons, several restaurants and a 7-11. You will be spoiled for choice, all within walking distance.

One small issue we encountered was that we could hear the people above us moving around in the morning, the floor creaked under their feet."

ChIJ8UwCKJ50j1QRykJnBrbQRM0,Spinnakers Gastro Brewpub & GuestHouses,4.2,48.4290663,-123.3850448,2084,"Not only is the view amazing but this place is well run. We had excellent service from our waitress even tho she was busy. We ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with truffles fries. My fried added pulled pork ($3 add on) in her gets and I added tomato ($2) and carmelized onion ($2) in mine. I don‚Äôt normally say this but this was the best grilled cheese I‚Äôve had anywhere. Fries were crispy, warm and seasoned just right.

We shared a piece of carrot cake and it was fabulous. I don‚Äôt like icing and this one only had icing between layers of moist cake. They finished it off with Carmelo sauce and spiced, candied nuts that are made in-house.

We also ordered some non-alcoholic cocktails and it was so good - we got seconds.

This was a fantastic evening and our bill came out to a very reasonable cost. Already planning to go back for their chowder.A local favourite that never disappoints! I come here often and am always impressed by the food and service. Recently, my server Mackenzie was so attentive and friendly. It‚Äôs such a comfortable atmosphere with a great view. Amazing breakfast sandwiches, with house made bread and smoked salmon. First time in for breakfast and I‚Äôll definitely be back!Took my high school friend here and she loved it! We sat downstairs. Upstairs the pub atmosphere is a little loud for dinner imo. Great pizza and fish and chips. Had the hazy IPA and double IPA. Fantastic! Most of all, our server Steve carried the day!! Super attentive and polite, his upbeat manner and extensive product knowledge was very much appreciated!! I‚Äôve been coming to Spinnakers since 1990 and it NEVER disappoints.A little off route as far as one would expect a decent pub/restaurant but still fairly accessible. Came in as a party of 9, which dwindled to 6. Bartender cut us off after 23 negroni's (fair as this was before 3:30), which was more or less shared by the table. Tried the farmhouse grilled cheese with pulled pork, not gonna lie phenomenal... the pulled pork had a delicious tang and the melted cheese, a combination made in heaven. Would recommend this place, if not only for the pulled pork grilled cheese. This being the first time i came, the staff was cordial but rather absent during most of the time spent there. Meal selection is rather limited, so that might be a drawback. Still great spot, fairly cheap, and a decent atmosphereThe service was slow and it was after 8 pm.
The place wasn't  busy. The food was excellent. Aside from one dish, the clam fettuccine. There was sand in a clam, and one  clam was exceptionally real salty. It didn't  get eaten. I will still give Spinakers a chance to earn a 5 star rating.
I don't  how soon though."

Staff is super friendly, rooms are immaculate and I love the retro vibe.  View is spectacular. We will be back to this well maintained piece of James Bay history.Owner was very friendly! She let us check in early,  which was much appreciated.  The room was great, nice and clean. We don't have any complaints except the room was very warm.

The location was great, amazing view of the water, staff were the nicest people ever. The rooms were spotless and bed was comfy. I love the retro feel. 10/10 would stay again.Stayed for 4 days in October and couldn‚Äôt have been happier - amazing views.  Could sit in bed and look at waves.  Fantastic location, lots of great walking around, close to inner harbour but better cause you‚Äôre on the ocean.

Loved the immaculately clean, retro feel of the room, with full kitchen.  I picked up a few groceries and made us coffee and breakfast every morning.

Loved it!  Thanks so much for keeping up this gem!"

ChIJXQ_ROJt0j1QReycbX9R-lhI,HI Victoria Hostel,3.2,48.4270086,-123.369793,104,"Very nice place. Close to downtown and the Seawall. I slept in one of the female dorms. There was about 4 of us in a room for 20, so it was very quiet in that way, but they're right across from a bar and it might be a bit noisy until 2ish. Showers are nice and hot. Everything seemed to be in good repair. Fitted sheets on the beds and towels that are not just white indicates they don't have a linen service or anything. Friendly staff. They'll let you leave your bag there during the day for free while you explore the city. I would come back againWas kept awake by people yelling outside every night.    The dorms are very large with up to 20 beds.   The carpet in the dorm is badly stained and I would rather have Linoleum in a dorm, so the floors could be mopped.    The kitchen compost was really piling up and it appeared it was only emptied once per week, since there were five, five gallon pails.    This is unsanitary as the compost was decomposing.   Kitchen area is very poorly designed.   It would be nice to have some new matching dishes as they are inexpensive to replace.  Staff  were helpful and friendly.     The pool table upstairs could be heard from downstairs eating area.   People were respectful.    Lights next to the beds would be helpful so you could have some light without lighting up the whole dorm.  My locker was in need of some paint on the inside as it was rather dirty.I found my stay at HI Victoria to be great.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place was quite clean.  Yeah, it's right on Yates and across the street from Lucky, so there's a good amount of noise at night but that's what earplugs are for.  The breakfast was typical hostel fare.  My bed was comfortable and the locker was a $5 deposit, of which $4 were returned on check-out.The staff individually are friendly and helpful. Victoria accommodations lean heavily on policies; this means they can not clean the washrooms but raise your cost of accommodations with ease.  This Hostel is definitely a young persons game. The furniture in the common areas is dated and not too comfortable- but if you continuously readjust you will be okay. The dining area is commonly used as a pseudo computer lounge. The kitchen is tight but it works. They do have safe storage. They do not have a courtesy phone- they have an old-school payphone that rarely accepts your quarters. There are two popular night club spots across the street. so that is loud. Yes it is close to town; but it's not the only place close to the city. If you need cheap accommodations- for short term and you are 35 and under- do it up.good place, and great price for the location. The dorms were clean and the staff helpful.
We booked for two nights from Friday to Sunday and when we got back from our day on Saturday, we learned that our all of our stuff had been put in garbage bags because they put us in the wrong room the first night... I think they should've called us and they shouldn't have touch our things (placed on our beds and locker) without our permission... it was super weird and nothing like that had ever happened to me while traveling. The second room was okay."
ChIJCTwod4Z0j1QR24q0ZokAyq0,Turtle Hostel,2.8,48.4282937,-123.3591633,165,"Worst experience in a hostel ever, i felt really not welcome by the owner. She call me at 7am to know if i was checking out, told my partner how to do our dishes, made us pullout money that she ended up never taking, maybe if they were taking credit they wouldn‚Äôt have to call us a 7am to give us the 30$ cash deposit for the key. The only highlight of the stay was Randy, a cool guy who made extra coffee for us and nice conversation. I do not recommend that hostel unfortunately and Randy is leaving anyway.Could be a really nice and quiet place but everything is dirty and you don‚Äôt feel really welcome by the man owner. Don‚Äôt leave at 11:01 cos he gonna be really angry and even knock at the door of the washroom you have to use before leaving every 20s to tell you you have to go. Really bad with guests and not smiling at all. The woman is nice though.It‚Äôs very good service under everyone budget and near to downtownTotally fine if you keep your expectations reasonable for $30. Cleanliness-wise, there was some old take out food in our room, a couple of empty bottles, and hairs in the shower but we didn‚Äôt mind that much since we just needed a place to sleep. The two guys working there were very nice and friendly and the place had student residence/communal vibes. I was a little scared off by the rating but it was ok for a hostel.Very affordable and great for the price. Fantastic location, even if it seems a little scary at first. Stayed here 6 nights near Christmas with my wife and we enjoyed it very much.
Appreciated:
- clean bathrooms, very good upstairs shower
- hostess Sue was helpful w sightseeing ideas; was understanding when we thought we lost our room key & offered a discount to replace it (didn't need to after all, found the key)
- near to Downtown & many restaurants
- chance to store leftovers & save groceries

If you're interested in saving money while visiting Victoria, I'd suggest Turtle Hostel. The simple and clean room and communal kitchen are a great value."
ChIJ12OHm3hzj1QRlqoT6icSaak,Super 8 Victoria BC,2.4,48.4418801,-123.3685988,27,"Very noisy at night if your room is on the side of the road. Great free breakfast, lots to choose from and if you wish gluten free it will be arranged.Went with our rugby club and they were tolerant of our large group and us hanging out at the hotel before going out on Saturday, which a lot of hotels are not!
I'm not too picky with cheap hotels, not no major complaints. However... one of our groups  found a used condom under the edge of the bed, which was pretty nasty! The staff handled this professionally and they were upgraded to a suite. Breakfast was fine too, but no waffles, lol!Rooms smell of mold, dusty and stained carpet, air conditioning is old, noisy and dusty. I was expecting a small fridge in the room but there is none, no microwave. Staff are a little aloft, it seems like they are scared of any complaints. Complimentary breakfast was good but no protein sources served nor any choices of fruits but old apples. I won't recommend this hotel to any family.The rooms are clean and good for the price. The elevator seems really old and feels very unsafe. The breakfast was average, and overall my experience was good but nothing that impressed me.Cheapest place in Victoria for a reason. Hotel is shutting down soon and maintenance is at an absolute minimum. Staff was very apologetic and nice. Wouldn't stay again. Hard lumpy bed. No AC. All furniture was broken."
ChIJG1Qsz5l0j1QRDcBjEBLIySk,Admiral Inn,4.3,48.4221318,-123.3758476,19,"We had a ground-floor 1 bedroom suite with queen bed and full kitchen. It was clean and in good condition, and a good size (for a couple). Had a full fridge, stove, and microwave and counter space. One closet for coats & shoes, and a larger closet in the bedroom. Nice desk for writing/computing. Wireless service worked well for the laptop. Patio door accessible through the bedroom leads to plastic outdoor table & 2 chairs on shared paved patio area with shrubs. Wonderful location downtown near the parliament building, and it's great for coastal walks along the boardwalks and trails.So obviously the owners are writing these reviews.  This place is aweful.  There is no breakfast provided. The only saving grace is that it was clean on arrival (not a hotel and not cleaned again whilst you are there). The rooms are very (very) small.  They have old tired furniture, the bathroom has not had any work done to it since the 1970's - unless painting the metal bath and tiles with gloss paint (which is now pealing off) is your idea of updating- there is no extractor fan so the entire 'suite' is full of condensation everytime you have a shower - there is a tiny window but this is at head height on the main walkway to all the other rooms so anyone can look in if the window is open. The  'kitchen' has about 2 feet of worktop and a single sink (again from the 1970's); there is a cooker but no extractor fan so everything smells like cooking all the time.  You have to shut the bedroom door or the bed and all your clothes will stink.  The walls between the 'suites' are so thin I can hear EVERY SINGLE WORD  said in the rooms either side of us. Although they are not suppose to the tenants smoke on the balconys and because the windows do not shut properly the smoke drifts into your room  The internet is painfully slow and at best intermittent - if you think you can use the internet to download or watch netflix you will be sorely disappointed. The heating is a joke there is a fan heater in the lounge with large clunky push buttons - this blows mildly warmer air into your room and there is a 1 foot wide electric bar heater in the bedroom - this we have to have on 24 hours a day and then heat the rest of the place up by turning on the oven. The noise of the other people trying to heat their rooms with these antiquated 'heating' units is so load you cannot sleep without ear plugs and even then you are still woken up when they turn on and off.  We are stuck as there are very few places that allow you to stay with pets as Victoria is very anti pets. Tonight there was a physical fight outside our room - banging against the walls - we felt very unsafe.  Do what ever you can to avoid this place we regret being stuck in this position.....Very accommodating with early check in, all our bags fit in one closet, comfy beds and above and beyond normal continental breakfast. Usually these types of coastal hotels try to get by on just location alone, but Admiral I'm really went all the way in providing excellent customer service.This was a sensible decision to stay at this hotel for 2 nights. Due to its superb location we could easily circumnavigate other nearby attractions for the day, then not feel rushed to find accommodations at the end of the day. Highly recommend.Rooms were clean, bed was very comfortable. Would have preferred a firmer pillow. Breakfast is included, and was great. I would stay here again."
ChIJ852DrXBzj1QRsNhtamMCMpI,Howard Johnson by Wyndham Victoria,3.2,48.4433287,-123.3784866,399,"Security guard came towards me and began to argue about my partner and I leaving . We called a cab and the cab from bluebird driver yelled at us and swore and drove away I asked for help fr security guard and all he did was raise his voice at me and refused to help me.vall I wanted to leave and go home just like he asked but instead he decided that he was going to be calling the police. Just because I did what he said he and asked of us which was to leave the property he gave us some time and after that time the cab driver came and left and upon leaving he the security guard came out and decided he was going to be aggressively loud and obnoxious with me and I will never recommend this place or this security guard for safety in any situation. I gave this place is zero out of zero thank youThe room was clean and air conditioned.  There was a coffee maker in the room and the complimentary muffin and yogurt were appreciated.  However, I have a couple of observations.  1) A damage deposit was automatically charged to my credit card with the comment that it would be refunded in 24 - 48 hours if there was not any damage to the room.  That was not indicated on their website or Trip Adviser.  What assurance do I have that hotel management would not 'claim' that there was damage to the room so that they would not have to credit back my deposit?  I do not appreciate the assumption of guilt on the part of the Howard Johnson organization.  2) It would have been nice if there were a stopper in the sink or if the bathtub stopper worked.  Also, for the amount I paid for the room, one would hope to have glass glasses and coffee cups, not plastic or paper!  Overall, a low passing grade.First things first: The room was quite clean, the beds were comfortable, and the view from our room was pretty nice. The kitchen suite was why we chose the hotel and it was equipped well enough to allow us to cook our suppers there. The price was very fair.

Aside from that, the hotel and it's decor are quite dated. Our room had an incredibly strong smell of a deodorizing spray or air freshener. It seemed as though there are a large number of people whom live at this hotel (not a negative, just a comment).

The pool area is nice enough, though spartan. The pool is allegedly 9' deep in the deep end, but I am not sure it was even 8'. Good size overall and nice to be able to play around in and throw a ball around. There is no hot tub, however both the men's and women's change rooms have dry saunas. The workout area has a treadmill, exercise bike, elliptical machine, and a TV to watch while you exercise.We arrived late, hungry and tired to discover the restaurant and bar were closed for renovation. As was the pool. Neither were mentioned upon booking the reservation days prior.
We stayed in an executive suite. It was fine. Clean except for the grungy carpets. Dated decor but this I could live with.
They seem to have some live-in tenants which on two of the nights had loud, aggressive, vulgar and lengthy arguments outside our room which kept us awake.
The water was cut off for 5 hours midway through my shower. Leaving me with sudsy hair.
We ended our stay early and moved to the holiday express which felt like the ritz in comparison.Sure, the beds are a little small, but the pillows are just fine! And it was SO CLEAN. Everyone was absolutely awesome, from front desk to room attendants. Restaurant is closed now due to lack of business, but they do offer free coffee and muffins in the morning. We have stayed at a few hotels this year, and this was by far my favorite, and the cleanest. Pool, exercise room, sauna too!(Travelodge on our last trip was the worst, so was the Sandman!)"
ChIJaQQYeaRzj1QRnF-ekJwJzJs,Travelodge by Wyndham Victoria,2.8,48.4427029,-123.3861167,130,"Room was stinking and we feel like being sick and they refused to change our room.. very bad service.. not recommended..When I first booked and went on a site, it showed free breakfast. I searched again, got a different website, and it showed no free breakfast, just Crow‚Äôs restaurant available. This bothered me a bit. I flip the comforter and it has a spill mark on it which means it was not washed. There‚Äôs black mildew all over the windows which was a little disturbing. We went to use the business centre and there was no power cord to printer. Thankfully the front desk lady let us send it to her email to print. The beds were comfortable which was great though. I think this hotel could do better with attention to detail. Very friendly staff though. Always smiling.The reason we picked this Hotel was because of the location and the fact it was pet friendly. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate my requirement for an early check in. The room was obviously one of the newly renovated ones and was clean with decent amenities.
Unfortunately the furniture had seen better days with chips and dings. One of the dressers had 2 legs on one side and was definitely left leaning . Despite the bathroom being recently renovated the tape between the ceiling and the wall was coming free  and there was glue on the floor from the laminate being installed. Also one of the screws missing from the beauty ring on the shower tap which is going to lead to water ingress and mould. The heat in the room had 2 modes hotter than hell or off. The PTAC air conditioner functioned but being winter we didn't bother using it.
The rooms are clean and functional with good amenities and a large screen TV. It was also extremely quite given that it was a Friday night. So If  you're looking for a lower priced decent alternative when travelling give this place a shot.Hotel was great. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Room was clean and tidy. We rented the 2 queen bed suite and the room was as big as a one bedroom apartment which was a nice surprise. The room itself was only $100 which was a steal of a price. They have laundry facilities and a great restaurant also. Would recommendA little pricey for the quality of the hotel, but it was not a bad spot for the night.  The crow crow restaurant was quite good.  The hotel is under Reno's, so we would stay again. Hopefully some of the issues, mostly cosmetic, will be addressed the next time.  The room was clean, but the duvet had a big burn hole in it. Staff was helpful and friendly."
ChIJAxoYupV0j1QRgdYx2yGWq6E,Carriage House Bed and Breakfast,4.9,48.4158083,-123.3695796,17,"Stayed at the Carriage House Bed and Breakfast for three nights while on a brief vacation to the island. As somebody who doesn‚Äôt drive but still wanted to make the most of the island experience, this place is situated perfectly close to downtown Victoria while not being close enough to be loud or frustrating. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to get either Downtown or to the water, whichever suits you best.

As for the room itself, we were lucky enough to get to stay in the cottage which was absolutely lovely. There was coffee and tea provided for us as well as filtered water, clean dishes and kitchen appliances that were clean and in working condition. The suite was incredibly tidy, quiet and private and there are many options for beds within the room.

Due to COVID restrictions, we didn‚Äôt see too much of the owners while we were staying there but they did call to check up on us the night we settled in AND wished us well on our way out. They seem like lovely people who are genuinely committed to providing a good experience for their customers.

I would 110% recommend this spot if you‚Äôre looking for a place to stay in Victoria. I can‚Äôt imagine how it could have been any better :)We stayed there during phase 2 of the provinces re-opening, so we didn't get a chance to have breakfast, but the hosts were extremely friendly and polite. The room was charming and comfortable, and the house is very well located in a quiet neighbourhood approximately 10 minutes from the city centre. It's also right across the street from a decebt pub frequented by locals. I would highly recommend staying at this bed and breakfast.Great little B&B.  Naoko and Dan were very quick to reply and easy to communicate with.  They accommodated some requests we had to the best of their ability.  The location is probably the best you can have without forking over a lot of money in Victoria, a few blocks away from the legislature, and a 5 minute walk from the harbour.  Their house was clean, breakfast was good, check in was easy.  Everything was as advertised.  They interacted with us a few mornings over breakfast and others they let us be.  They're a really friendly couple who deserve your dollar.Nice place. Few steps away from the local Starbucks. The people working there were really nice. The breakfast was great! Enjoyed my stay.Lovely place,good place to stay, place is clean,calm and quiet in the downtown of Victoria. Beacon hill park I s in walkable distance"
ChIJ4zIZAI50j1QRrvc9DV7QeHk,Abigail's Hotel,4.9,48.4210127,-123.3598561,348,"A truly classic British style hotel. The room was beautiful with a very comfortable bed and really clean. There were two sets of stairs though! Everything looks very Victorian and fits the city of Victoria very well. The hotel is within walking distance to Victoria downtown. Our room was pretty quiet at night. The staff was very friendly and helpful and also assisted us in lifting our heavy suitcases up the staircase. The breakfast was super delicious as well.My wife and I had a wonderful stay this weekend at Abigail's Hotel. The location is very central and convenient. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and have everything you need. I appreciated the thought that went into every detail - from the location of the wall plugs, to the free snacks. The employees were very personable and kind. The real highlight, however, is the breakfast. It is like no hotel breakfast I have ever had - and better than most restaurants! There are gourmet options like eggs Benedict and Belgian waffles. Could not recommend this hotel enough.Our first visit to Abigail‚Äôs Hotel was a delightful experience. All staff were friendly and professional and our room in the Carriage House was spotless with everything in its place. The handwritten personalized welcome card (and cookies) were a nice surprise, as was the relaxing background music that made our first moments in our room so comforting.
The included breakfast each morning was a special treat - thanks chef :)
The library/lounge, adjacent to the lobby, was cozy with comfy chairs and also a table should you want to play cards or a board game.
An easy 10 minute walk gets you to the inner harbour with all the popular shops and attractions.
We‚Äôve travelled globally, and can honestly say Abigail‚Äôs Hotel ranks in our top ten!
We‚Äôll definitely be back!! ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èI wish I could live here. I loved every moment of our stay. The friendly staff welcomed us into the stunning hotel making us feel right at home. From the gorgeously appointed rooms to the scrumptious breakfast in the dining room we felt at home and welcomed. We stayed in the Tiffany Rose room on the fourth floor. Trudging up the stairs (being in one of the older buildings there is no elevator for some of the rooms) we were rewarded with a beautiful room including a warming fireplace and a large soaking claw foot tub that we were sure to take advantage of. I can‚Äôt say enough good things about Abagail‚Äôs Hotel and we will be back as soon as we can.Stayed here for a little getaway and loved everything about it. The location is great,  walking distance to both downtown and Beacon hill park. The service was amazing.  The breakfast was great and we loved the late afternoon appetizers that were put out daily. It's all the small touches that really add up. We especially loved the music playing in our room apon arrival. This place has an oldworld charm that we truly appreciate. The bed was comfy and the sheets were amazing. We would definitely stay here again and can't wait to return."

The rooms are quiet and clean in a well maintained historic building situated next to the sea. Check-in & out was easy and our hosts were friendly and attentive throughout our stay. Hotel grade amenities (and very comfortable beds) but in a way more relaxed setting. The only place to stay for us in Victoria really! Thanks :)Great location, beautiful old heritage home in a surprisingly quiet neighborhood considering how close it is to downtown. You can easily walk to a lot of sights/attractions, including the ocean and Beacon Hill Park. Continental breakfast included fruit, yogurt and lots of lovely pastries, although I wouldn't have minded a greater selection of savory &/or protein choices and a communal dining area so we could meet up with other guests. There are always granola bars/candies/snacks, you can always brew yourself a coffee or tea, and the hosts are lovely - what's not to like? :-)We stayed in the Sydney room of this gorgeous heritage house, which was lovely and bright with a delightfully comfortable bed and even had a bit of an ocean view. Shannon and the hosts were fantastic and went out of their way to get gluten free and dairy free breakfast options for the morning (which was so appreciated!).
The location is fantastic being one block from both Beacon Hill Park and my favourite rocky beaches along Dallas Rd, as well as a pleasant walk to downtown. I highly recommend this gem of a B&B and I am glad to know that we've found a home away from home for whenever we're next in Victoria. Pictured here is the sunroom view of the delicious breakie enjoyed by my partner.Just back from a 4 day visit to Victoria, our favorite get-away city.  We
stayed at the Ashcroft House in the James Bay area, a departure form our normal hotel or condo in the downtown area.  We were very pleased with our decision.  Not only was the accommodation perfect for us (kitchenette and great bed in a heritage house with a great hostess Shannon) but the neighborhood was wonderful to walk in.  We enjoyed walks along the ocean front, Beacon Hill Park and the surrounding neighborhood with all the heritage homes.  We‚Äôre already planning a return visit next month.This was our second time staying at Ashcroft House in the last 3 months. This time we stayed in the Jennings Burnett suite. It is so beautiful, sleeps 4. The Beacon Hill Park area is amazing, everything is in walking distance, beaches, downtown Victoria and I highly recommend a stroll through Beacon Hill Park to the shops along Cooke street."

She gives amazing recommendations on where to eat and what to do. Free parking. close to most things. Would highly recommend.My husband and I stayed at Fisher House on October 4 and October 5, 2019.  It was a fabulous experience. We were met, on arrival, by our delightful Innkeeper, Jennifer who was a wonderful host. The Inn was very Victorian, beautiful and the breakfasts were outstanding. Our bedroom and bed were luxurious. We did have a private bath, but it was across the hall. A little unique, but not a problem! I‚Äôd love to come again!Beautiful house and location to tour around Victoria. Jenn made wonderful meals in the morning to set is up properly for our day. Beds were comfy and very clean.

The hosts and service are just awesome and the house very cosy with love to many details. Thank you for having us, wish you all the best.We had a wonderful visit!  It's a beautiful house,  with period furnishings. A lovely gardens.  The breakfast was delicious.My wife and I recently got a chance to stay at Abbeymoore Manor and its quiet location was the perfect place to relax.  The property is set in a quiet neighborhood with relatively easy walking access to downtown (about 1 mile), a shopping center with a grocery, access to a beachfront and Craigdarrogh Castle.  The staff were extremely helpful, especially the owner Jeff who was will to lend us a car when a small emergency came up.  We stayed in one of the garden suites on the bottom level which was really well appointed, and would have been great if we would have wanted to make our own meals.  The room also featured an amazing bathtub which was perfect for a good soak.  The only downside was that since the room was on the lowest level it tended to be humid, but the staff had thoughtfully left a fan to help circulate the air.  The breakfast were delicious and creative.  Each meal started with a sweet course (yogurt parfait, waffles) often garnished with seasonal berries followed by a savory main course (fried egg, chicken & mac & cheese; eggs benedict; fried egg on top of hash potatoes).  The Abbeymoore is cozy and comfortable with a great deal of charm.Just stayed at Abbeymoore Manor in Victoria. We had a delightful stay. Not only are the garden be rooms charming, the staff was lovely. Jeff and his crew went above and beyond what they needed to to make our stay wonderful. I had many pleasant conversations with them. I broke my wrist while hiking and they took such good care of me when I returned from the hospital, bringing me blankets when they worried I might be cold. I will definitely be returning.Comfortable Victorian Victoria!

Liked ¬∑ This was a delightful stay in a comfortable old house. Very quiet, and easy access to downtown and Government House. Well-appointed room and bathroom, very comfortable bed and seating areas. The lounge was large and comfortable as well. Henry served up two spectacular breakfasts - notably different each day. You're away from the noise and hustle of the downtown area, and a wonderful neighbourhood to explore on foot, gawking at the gorgeous homes."
ChIJpz8OWfV0j1QRVpicsMxgfDo,Joan Brown's Bed and Breakfast,4.5,48.4207833,-123.3397262,8,"My wife, Julie, and I stayed with Joan in August (2019) and were more or less bowled over by the comfort and elegance of our accommodations in the ""Blue Room."" The house is architecturally interesting and beautiful, and filled with antiques. The dining room has quite possibly the most beautiful stained glass windows that we have seen in a home. Our room was amazing, and furnished with antiques and art. Breakfast is multi-course and simply wonderful. It is served in the comfortable and antique-furnished dining room on English china and sterling silver (no silver plate here), and was delicious. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Joan is absolutely delightful - both service oriented and interesting to visit with. It is said that ""To be rude is very bad, but to be boring is unforgiveable!"" Joan is both polite, and fascinating to talk to. What a wonderful stay! Highly recommended.I adore Joan!

I stayed here for two nights with my work team on a strategic retreat. It's a beautiful old colonial house in a gorgeous neighbourhood filled with lovely gardens, bees, deer, strolling people who smile and say hello, and within 7 minutes of downtown by car.

Joan's home is full of art, keepsakes, photographs, books, cds, bedrooms and bathrooms and a large garden with a couple of seating areas for reading, chatting and just relaxing.

Though my favourite place in the entire house is the kitchen - it's homey, and Joan is there :) She does most of the baking and cooking, and works hard to be as environmentally friendly as possible, which I appreciate very much.

The breakfasts are beautiful and generous. Lovely fruit plate, and one morning it was eggs cooked in bell peppers and baked with cheese on a potato patty with a tomato & salsa on the side, and the next was the biggest waffle with the best bacon I have ever had along with homemade rhubarb sauce.

There are no locks on the doors to the bedrooms, as someone mentioned, and it's not massive ensuite bathrooms people have become accustomed to in opulent hotels or chain suites... it's homey, interesting period rooms that attract people I feel safe and comfortable around, and Joan is always nearby.

Highly recommended! Tell her I sent you!Fabulous happy and superbly fed weekend for me and my family.  Our son Ben took a photo of the breakfast table groaning with delicious food.  This should be on the index page of the web site.  It would attract hordes!

As a hobby web page maker, I suggest that the name of the business and web site be changed to ""Bed and breakfast with Joan Brown"" - or something like that.  This would move her up alphabetically on the listings.

Commendable, enjoyable, great food, great elegance, Joan is an excellent and charming host, great location.I LOVE going to Joan Brown's B&B..Very relaxed atmosphere  beautiful house & grounds.  Joan is an awesome hostess & cook and has a welcoming personality!!Booked for 7 nights but on day 3 got told by the host we had to leave due to ‚Äútiredness‚Äù and ‚Äúcan‚Äôt be bothered with a B&B anymore‚Äù even though she was accepting new guests‚Ä¶ very unprofessional and unpleasant host, wouldn‚Äôt recommend to my worse enemy!"

The fact we had to leave before sampling more of the host's AMAZING breakfasts. Super relaxing and idyllic. Highly recommended - book it!This was my first BNB experience and it was everything we could have dreamed of. My mom and I stayed here for two nights. We were both completely charmed and completely satisfied. Vanessa was the perfect host, and we couldn't have asked for more. The Gingerbread Cottage is full of character, quirks, charm, and stuffed with history, treats, and curiosities. I would recommend it for just the breakfast. The location is amazing as well. Quiet but close enough to downtown and Dallas Rd that my mother, who doesn't like walking, walked everywhere with me. The Gingerbread Cottage was a big part of the wonderful memories I have of my visit to Victoria with my mother. Please go stay with Vanessa! Thank you, Vanessa.Vanessa provides a cozy and welcoming place to stay.  Each room is filled with art and history.  Very tidy and functional rooms.  It felt like we were staying with a friend!  Home-made Everything, with a twist of passion and creativity, for breakfast.  Vanessa is one of the most wonderful gourmet chefs that I have ever had the pleasure of encountering.  I dream about the breakfast that she made for us!  Thank you so much, Vanessa & Sweet Helper Lady.  We very much enjoyed our stay, and definitely recommend The Gingerbread Cottage!  Great location as well.  :)Absolutely loved our stay. Vanessa is amazing, her cooking is amazing, and she provides a warm relaxing atmosphere. We enjoyed our conversations with her and appreciated her input on places to go. The house is decorated well and maintains a fun old feel. This cottage is located well. We walked most places and only drove when we went North to the gardens, and the Haunted Mansion tour. Walking distance to shopping, dining, and fun. Vanessa recommended a place to get fried fish that was actually really good! We will come again on our next holiday. Great place, great value, and we would definitely recommend a stay.A wonderful place to spend your time in Victoria! A lovely, cool, spacious room with a delightful patio. Breakfast was huge!!

Hospitality was great and the staff helped us with all our needs. No air conditioning but the room temperature can still be pleasant by using the provided fans and opening all the windows.

Relatively comfy sofa bed too. Quite satisfied with this inn.Fantastic little cottage style hotel, only a block and a half from the Empress and Parliament. You'll enjoy the charm of the old building, and the staff is friendly and mellow, which gives it a sleepy and relaxing tone, something I quite admired. I would recommend one change only, and this may have just been my bad luck, but it was my experience regardless: I would enforce a slightly more rigorous noise policy. There were two groups on the 3rd floor (across and beside) with teenagers or loud adults that took the noise to a very high level, albeit within hours. Because the hotel's charm is centered around it being quiet, restful and dainty in a sense, I would really try and protect that culture. The teenagers on the first night, 3rd floor (Feb 17th from 4pm to about 9pm) were screaming from their deck to people walking the street, laughing loudly and telling people to ""get some"". It was not a good sight. Granted, after that night they either left or quieted down completely, and I suspect that the hotel staff may have kicked them out.

Anyway, 5 stars all around, but I would kindly suggest that you really guard the noise levels. We will be back, we loved it.Friends, you are just wonderful, everything is fine.  I give it a 4 only because the windows were dirty.
It seems that these windows have not been washed for six months.  And maybe more guys, please keep an eye on it Clean the windows.  It's the same view.Cute place to visit for your trip to Victoria. Really close to the parliament building and the fisherman wharf. Great locations to visit for food and local scenery.

Rooms were very clean and modern. Good enough for couples that don't need too much space.This is our favourite place to stay in Victoria. Tucked a block south of the Legislative Buildings in quiet James Bay. The ambience is like stepping back to the quiet of old Victoria.

The service is always incredible. The staff are wonderful at accommodating needs.

Miss the breakfasts, though. Waiting for a little thing called a pandemic to be over to bring them back."

My husband and I have stayed in every room/suite except the French Country Garden and each one is beautifully decorated and beds are comfortable.

The location is great. They are next to the Government House that has a beautiful garden. Close enough to the inner harbour that you can either walk in 30 minutes or drive.

And the breakfasts, OMG, they are delicious and different each day. I love sitting at a table visiting with Sylvia and Ross along with the other guests from all over the world. It‚Äôs a great way to start your day.

I have been too many bed and breakfasts and none compare to Fairholme Manor.  I am looking forward to going back in the next couple of weeks and this time with my daughter for her 40th birthday.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to stay here - you will not regret it.

Thank you Sylvia and Ross for welcoming us into your beautiful home!

Brenda and MarkWe booked is BnB day-of on a Sunday morning after we decided to stay one extra day in Victoria. Sylvia was so sweet and accommodating. As soon as we walked in, the house smelt like vanilla and honey and cinnamon from the homemade granola she was making. Sylvia checked us in and brought us to our room. We had to leave really early the next morning so she prepared a breakfast tray of yogurt, said granola, and strawberries we could keep in the fridge in our room to have ready. After a busy weekend and morning of exploring the city and lots and lots of walking, we really wanted somewhere to relax and not do much. This ended up being the perfect place. Our room was on the round floor and we saw lots of deers around the grounds eating from the feeders placed around. Luxurious bathroom to take a long bubble bath in and some of the softest robes to wrap up in afterwards. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone coming through Victoria. Sylvia seemed to be so excited and passionate about her home and sharing it with each and every guest to come through.From the moment we booked with a short note on our dietary questions, we received a call back thanking us for booking and asking how they could prepare for our stay. The room was amazing with many fine touches and abundant in comfort. The Inn and the grounds are delightful and private, easy to park and is as refreshing as having a second home with no hassles of hotel parking. The breakfast was very high quality of freshly baked breads and pastries, fresh seasonal berries, poached eggs (cooked perfectly I might add) and smoked salmon, with options and they remembered our dietary requests amazingly well! What was even more special is the fine experience of genuine hospitality from Sylvia, Ross, Judy and their caring staff that went above and beyond. This is our new home away from home whenever we revisit Victoria.As always Sylvia and Russ provide an inviting and delightful environment. Breakfast is exquisite. The scenery and surroundings are a gift from God. We will be backI  needed a room in Victoria and impulsively booked Fairholme, thinking it was an average B&B. Upon arrival it became clear that Fairholme Manor was something truly special and that I'd lucked out in a big way. Sylvia greeted me and showed me the room - the Grand Olympic Suite, no less - and while I tried to pick my jaw up from the floor she showed me the sun room, balcony, garden...all stunning. Beautifully furnished and decorated, full of light, sea view....From the bathroom window you can see the grounds of Government House next door! My friend who is an antiques dealer was seriously impressed by the decor and the lovely European antiques and art that make Fairholme a standout. It was like living in Craigdarroch Castle but better, because Sylvia also makes the most beautiful breakfast! Raspberry lavender loaf? Scones with clotted cream? Homemade bread? Plus fruit, yogurt, homemade granola....simply amazing. Sylvia and Ross are also friendly and knowledgeable hosts who are incredibly helpful and truly want you to have a fantastic visit in Victoria. I'm so grateful for their kind welcome and restaurant recommendations - Sylvia literally called the restaurant and snagged us a reservation. I was supremely comfortable and will be returning. I promised the deer I would be back..."

The suite was bright with lots of windows and the garden areas were beautiful.  We sat outside every afternoon and read our books.

The bed was comfortable and the shower had lots of hot water.  There were a few breakfast options including fresh fruit and cereal or pancakes or ham and eggs.

We will be back.In 1995 my husband and I stayed in the Cottage at Heathergate House and loved it.  I had the wonderful opportunity to stay there again recently with three family members.  It was as lovely as it was before!  The outside courtyard/garden is absolutely beautiful and is the perfect place to have a cup of coffee before heading out for a day of sightseeing.  The cottage itself is clean, spacious, comfortable, bright and well appointed.  The fridge and cupboards were well stocked with more food than the four of us could eat during our 5 day stay.  Heathergate House is conveniently located in James Bay, close to everything!  Ned and Ann are consummate hosts and made us feel very welcome.  I would recommend Heathergate House to anyone who wants to ensure a wonderful visit to Victoria, BC.Had a wonderful stay here with my husband! Ned and his wife provided top class customer service!

The owner went above and beyond for me and made sure there were flowers waiting for my wife when we arrived.  She also let us check in early and helped out in many ways.  The loft had every amenity you would need and the kitchenette with fridge and everything was very convenient.  The room was clean and incredibly well decorated.  We were able to park on the property but there was also tons of street parking available.  You are close enough to downtown to easily walk but far enough away to get out of the hustle and bustle.  There are a couple unique coffee shops within a block as well.  This didn't diminish our stay at all but I would warn you ahead of time that the stairs to the bed are pretty steep and there isn't much storage space for luggage, so you will be going up and down the stair a lot.  I would highly recommend staying here for a weekend getaway!  Thank you so much for the hospitality!Gorgeous property in Victoria. The rooms are spacious and well decorated and the view of the gardens make you feel like you are in quiet little oasis. It‚Äôs located very close to everything downtown and is easily walkable to shopping, food and exploring. I‚Äôll most definitely be back again! Thank you to the great hosts!What a treat! Auberge is a delightful home away from home. You can tell the owners have put a lot of love and thought into every detail at this property, there is endless character and charm. The property is almost 2 km from the main town centre, but it‚Äôs worth the walk and we were happy to do so. Check-in was a breeze (we didn‚Äôt even have to engage with the owners, but they were around if we had any issues). Having access to a washing machine and dryer was also an added bonus. We stayed in the Magnolia suite and it was definitely on the warmer side (we were there in summer) and whilst this didn‚Äôt bother us too much, if you‚Äôre easily perturbed by feeling a little clammy, this may not be the place for you. For us though, we would definitely stay there again.Great place to stay. We rented the Carriage House and it was gorgeous. Beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Within a twenty minute walk of the Inner Harbour and some delicious restaurants. Would definitely recommend.This is a little hidden gem within Victoria , we stayed for 2 nights , excellent service , very  clean and perfectly organized , very cozy atmosphere , we stayed at the magnolia suite , very comfortable beds , very tasteful interior , kitchenette is very well equipped , everything is so well thought out and very well managed , I can recommend this place anytime , I‚Äôm sure we will be back !"
