The room was spotless and tidy, wholly renovated, relaxed, quiet, and cozy. The beds and linens were super comfy and clean. The decoration was modern and chic. The bathroom was really clean. Also, the staff is very friendly and helpful. They put some chocolates and a lovely welcome letter for us in the room. Moreover, the location is perfect! Only a few minutes to downtown and excellent access to everything! We enjoyed our stay at this fantastic hotel. We'll definitely get back here again. Strongly recommended!


From the moment I walked through the door I have had amazing treatment, the rooms are new, clean and I love the decor details. I have received nothing but first class service from the staff. As a traveling business person it’s very appreciated. I have received amazing service, truly above and beyond.

This will be my new Victoria accommodation every time I’m in town. There is a pub/comedy club below the hotel so you don’t need to go far for dinner. I received top notch service in both the hotel and restaurant! I look forward to my return.


AWESOME! Great room with board games, Foosball, ping-pong,TV and couches. Free complimentary snacks... Have you ever seen a mirror with a power button?! I haven't until I went to our room. We were like two idiots pressing buttons on and off.. great shower.... comfortable beds (except for pillows, but it's just me). The staff checked with us after we arrived if everything is good. We liked everything but breakfast. Flat pancakes that are hard to cut, oversugared waffles... I don't know. The rest is awesome.


Pros: clean rooms, comfortable beds with great bedding, good location just outside of downtown, friendly service, an a nice rec room. Breakfast was tasty. Plenty of parking too.
Cons: There are no ironing boards or irons in the rooms, you have to call reception to request it. Which leads to the second problem: there are no clear instructions to dial reception anywhere in the room or on the phone. No vending machines, and only food and drink source in the hotel closes at 3 pm. Had to walk to an attached liquor store to buy a pop and chips.

Recommendation to hotel: Include a welcoming guide with information on how to dial reception (unless it's was only missing only in room 244) and how to get an iron/ironing board, essential for clientele. Partner up with a vending machine owner, usually it's free!

Overall: It's a good hotel, but I'll try a different hotel next time.


The rooms are cute and clean and the staff are very attentive. One of my concerns was around safety - we came home around 10 pm on Thursday and couldn’t find parking, so we went to the underground parking. It was empty, except for a disheveled looking man smoking something. As two girls travelling by ourselves we did not feel safe parking there. We eventually found a spot outside. I would recommend the hotel add a gate or other security feature in the future. Otherwise we would definitely stay here again.

I had a fantastic stay here back in March and I’m looking forward to coming back to Victoria and staying here again. Our room was a good size, the bed was comfortable, the heating was at a perfect temperature, and yes, the bathroom sink was located across from our bed and not in the bathroom, but that will happen in hotels that are over 100 years old. If you go to Europe, you will also see this from time to time. We also got a great recommendation for breakfast (John’s Place) from the staff as we chose to sleep in and missed our breakfast at Bard & Banker (an excellent pub that we were at the night before). All in all, I was very happy with our stay!


My husband and I regularly stay in a harbour view room on the 3rd floor and we love it, especially the wood burning fireplace and the jacuzzi tub. This is an old building, but immaculately clean and comfortable. The location is ideal for checking out the sights and scene of downtown Victoria. The staff are wonderful as well. 100 percent would recommend!


Spent a couple days at this hotel. I found it quite charming, I loved the older style architecture and styling choices. It wasn’t just another bland business hotel. It was a great price in the heart of downtown  Victoria and had two pubs on either side. The carpet was actually really thick and they had personal AC for each room. The staff was friendly and prompt (when the elevators broke in the morning they were fixed by the time I returned in the late evening). The bed wasn’t the comfiest and I wasn’t a fan of how my room window was facing the windows of other rooms across from me (separated by about 2 - 3 meters). I didn’t see anyone else in the other rooms but if it was busier it may have been more of a hinderance.

Overall, I would visit it again and recommend for others who are cost conscious and looking for a unique feel.


Clean, very friendly and efficient staff, and within 15-20 minute walking distance to everything you'd want to see near the old town. Nothing fancy, but it's comfortable and comes with all the basic amenities. My booking came with breakfast at the Bard & Banker which was excellent, and the hotel lets you leave your bag free of charge at reception if you want to check out in the morning, but will not be leaving the island until the evening.


Lovely boutique style hotel, reminds me of Paris! Fabulous location to park your car offsite, and walk to everything. Dozens of restaurants with outdoor patio seating as well all within walking distance. Our room was quiet, very clean, recently updated and the only downside was a lack of working plug-ins...but it did not hinder a great three night stay. Would absolutely  stay again and great value in the inner harbour

Service started at the front door with a smile and continued with front desk staff always available and friendly.

The bed here was probably the most comfortable one I've ever slept on in a hotel. Temperature was easy to control and noise levels were great as the property is not on a busy street. Hallway noise is evident when the hotel is busy but I brought a white noise machine that covered all of that overnight.

The restaurant was great if pricey for breakfast, custom locally made jam was amazing and the crab cake eggs Benedict was delicious.

Our only complaint was the lack of towels at the pool and the quality of them when they were available. They were very thin, meaning many guests seemed to take 2-4 each, which is probably why they ran out so often. I made calls to the front desk twice when the basket was empty and only once was it filled before we left the pool. Just a very small area of service that needs improvement.


I stayed at this hotel for the Victoria day long weekend and was quite disappointed with my stay. The AC unit in the room is automated and will turn off after the room is at an arbitrary range. There's no option to keep it running. I don't know if that's to save on the electricity bill, but it seems silly to not allow the guest the option to choose. There was also a mini fridge in corner of the room that seemed like an interesting option to keep drinks cool but it will randomly start making a loud noise in the middle of the night which meant I had to unplug it. The bathroom was incredibly tiny, and the fan didn't work. After a shower, the entire bathroom would become muggy, making it extremely unpleasant for my wife if she wanted to shower afterward. The shower being so tiny also led to some water spilling out of the tub and on to the bathroom floor. Room cleaning services also happened at different times throughout the day. On our first night, it happened at 4:00PM, and on the following, they showed up toward 11:00AM. Overall, I would not recommend this hotel, definitely not for the premium I paid based on long weekend prices on top of valet charges. I wasn't asked how my stay was on my way out, so I'm airing my grievances here for anyone who thinks about staying here.


Great hotel, very nice rooms, excellent room service. Overall, this is a new fave for my coworkers who travel here on business very frequently, 6 of us were staying here in 6 separate rooms. The location is ideal & convenient to everything. This my 1st stay & it was great. Only thing I didn't like was that my pillows smelled like the bald head of an old man, weird & gross. Change the pillows, or wash them, and I'm sure we'll keep coming back.


Conveniently located close to the water and downtown Victoria. Rooms are spacious and comfortable. Staff was friendly and attentive to guests.

The lounge club was very comfortable and had great food. I also worked out of the club lounge for long period of time (5 + hours) and I found the location quiet and comfortable to work. Recommend staying here!


While this is a Marriott, (so you kind of expect a ""chain"" experience), the staff here make all the difference and take the time to look after guests. The manager was present and very attentive too. Traveling with dogs can be problematic and stressful, but they even had suggestions for local eateries that welcome dogs on the patio... The location is also a perfect blend of central yet quiet, with safe parking, and the room we were given was huge, clean, smelled pleasant and the bed was super comfy... This was our second visit, and I'm sure we will be back!

I have lived here for the past 8 months because the person and people here have given me refuge. I have been fortunate enough to live in a society where people like the ones I have lived with understand what it means to have a roof unto ones head. The owner of this establishment gives to others in need. During the summer months it becomes necessary for economic reasons to evacuate those that don't have the means. We understand. During the rest of the year, those in need can still find refuge. Thank you.


Bless him the manager did his best. But he could do with a clean shirt perhaps.it was not quite a salubrious as expected but it was a bed and bathroom for the night with parking. Room was large X2 queen beds  with kitchenette and AC.


Nice Inn keeper. Provides breakfast everyday. Long term residence are very nice. Rooms also come with kitchens, so you can cook, dishes, pans and cutlery provided, as well as fridge and complimentary coffee in your room with machine


I'm really happy about this place. The owner was  nice and friendly. The room was big, comfortable, and the location was good


It is a very old hotel which the owner is trying to update. And doing a good job. First impressions from the outside some might think ' what a dive ' . Please don't judge from the outside. HUGE ROOMS some with kitchens with full size fridge microwaves etc. Other rooms still huge with microwave coffee machine and mini fridges for now. Very clean beds very comfortable. Great pillows...black out curtains but need some new ones. For smokers or not patio tables with w chairs outside your door. Owners are extremely nice. Parking lot exceotionallt well lit. Best of all the price is the best!!

The staff were very nice. It is very clean. Our room had a full kitchen. The best point about this place is the location it is very close to bus stop and only 10-15 minutes to downtown. A Walmart and a big uptown shopping centre nearby.
If only the pool was open and the provided free breakfast, I would rate 5 stars. Also, they didn’t charge us extra for Christmas holiday only the price we booked in advance.


Hotel is ok for the price.  Everything was clean.  What sets this property apart from others is that front desk staff are exceptionally courteous and beyond-the-call personable.  Manager Chris couldn’t do enough to be helpful; personable and friendly.  Good experience.  It’s a little out of the city center, but there is good bus service to city center and a taxi is about $15 Canadian.


It was nicely renovated and clean. My wife couldn’t sleep due to the noise from the next room, and fridge next to her bed😅💦🙏🏻
We like it there though, it is just a price was not the cheapest, but we do understand that it is a BC price. People at the front desk was very friendly. Thank you so much!


A great location, close to Uptown mall and a brisk walk to downtown.  Galloping Goose trail runs behind the hotel and transports you to hidden beauty. Only issue is garbage collection in parking lot behind our room at 4:30 am a couple times. But desk staff and maid service is excellent and polite.


In a world full of horrible customer service it was extremely refreshing to have stayed here. Our room was everything we needed and hotels location was perfect. The front desk manager Chris and his staff were very friendly and accommodating. We will definitely be returning. Very good value.

They offer nightly rental deals as well as monthly stay rates. 60 $ a night is a fantastic deal for downtown Victoria. They allow pets so you can bring your best buddy with you. There is a park right beside this hotel so perfect for your furry friend. You have a bus stoop right in front so it's easy to get around and only minutes from downtown. They have a restaurant and bar on site. Great meals decent prices. Highly recommend this place if travelling or if you just want a break from life for a weekend.


This is actually pretty decent place to crash a night if you are in budget. The check in and check out process were very straightforward. I could access my room from side stairs so that was a bonus. No unnecessary noises or anything, comfy beds. So I mean you can't go wrong with their affordable nightly tariff. Locations is not bad either, apparently there is a path that leads straight to downtown. Also it's near Selkirk Trestle so at night time you and your friends can take advantage and check out that spot as it comes in one of the places to see when in Victoria. Overall I was very satisfied and if you want to visit Victoria in a budget, you should def consider this.


This is an older hotel but the rooms were clean. Probably could do with a little TLC. We only needed a place for our head at night so it did what it needed to do. Definitely not a romantic getaway if that's what you're looking for. The staff however were amazing, so friendly, so helpful, 100% on the staff.
This hotel is a 10 min taxi ride or drive into Victoria harbor, give or take with the traffic. I wouldn't recommend it, and I wouldn't deter people from staying here, just depends on what you're looking for.
Side note, it did look like there was lower income residents staying here also.


Pretty nice hotel.Little expensive but the rooms were pretty huge with the kitchenette. Also they have a beautiful water view from the place. Have a lot of parking. They do not have breakfast options as they have their own restaurant downstairs, so it could be a technique to get people into their own pub. Staff was helpful. Lighting is less in the room. They just have 2 lamps for Lighting.


This was part of a package deal with BC ferries, so I drove down from Sidney.  It has a fantastic location, directly across the street from Black Ball Ferry and the Victoria Clipper. Easily walkable to all the Inner Harbor attractions. Staff are great, food service is FAST! Only 2 things- the room I had-409- has a funky bathroom- it is one step up from the rest of the room while the toilet is very low. You may also want to check the temp of the hot water supply as it easily reaches a high enough temp to make a cup of tea and can be difficult to lower to a more tolerable temperature.
On the other hand WHERE can I purchase your pillows!!
Will definitely stay here again. Oh! The price is very reasonable.

The facilities are very clean and the staff are always so friendly and willing to answer any questions. The rooms I have stayed in have been thoroughly cleaned and the shared bathrooms have also always been clean when I’ve used them. The location is so central and great transit wise! The building is older and has so much cool character and a great vibe. Also you can’t beat the free breakfast provided, such an awesome addition. I’ve only had the dinner provided once but it was so good. They also have lockers you can leave your bag in for the day after you check out. I’d highly recommended staying here and I’ll definitely be back!


This is an awesome place. A real gift to Victoria. Great location. Rooms are clean and minimalist. The sound doesn’t really carry so even though there’s a lot of people you aren’t too bothered by noise. I love the old heritage wood floors. My room had a small fridge and good lighting, comfy bed and clean sheets. There’s a shared kitchen so you can save money by cooking your own meals. For $65 including breakfast and dinner, I really don’t know how anyone could complain about this place!! Some people are really so ungrateful.


This is a great hostel. The rooms and bathrooms were very clean. The staff was friendly and helpful. As a budget traveller I really appreciated that breakfast and supper come with the room, it makes a huge different in how expensive it is to travel to Victoria. Nice atmosphere in the hostel, not a party place. A diverse clientele, mostly people in their 20's and 30's, but also some older visitors. The downtown location is easy to get around on foot or with the buses. I am a woman travelling alone and I felt safe, both in the hostel and walking around the surrounding neighbourhood.


Quite good for the price, with major caveats. Be aware that any last-minute booking is likely to be a top bunk in a shared dorm. This is really more of a hostel than a hotel, although I have previously stayed in a private room here, which was exceedingly small and did not come with a private shower or toilet. I had no issues with cleanliness on either stay. The clientele is cosmopolitan -- I noticed Germans, Irish and French-Canadian in my short one-night stay. There are many homeless people outside and nearby, and not all of them are your friend, and some of them are noisy. I did see a mouse come out of the kitchen into the dining area. The staff member I alerted pretty much said ""what are you going to do? We have traps out."" Not sure what a good reaction would have looked like, but that wasn't quite it. Something to keep in mind if you are planning a longer stay that involves storing food. There are fridges, and on the whole the kitchen seemed quite clean, with most dishes getting washed by the people that used them, and somebody apparently staying on top of the ones that weren't. The free breakfast was better than many hotels provide, about 80th percentile, including orange juice, eggs, toast and waffles with butter and jam.


Okay, this place gets very mixed reviews and I wanted to leave my opinion on what to expect.
First off this hostel was alright, there was a bed and I felt secure in my dorm room. There were privacy curtains and good lockers. The sheets were clean enough even though I didn't actually use them. The entire place felt pretty unclean but nothing to make me run for the hills. There was a mouse running around the dining area after dinner and the people who worked there were talking about it saying it's been running around for a while, so note they know it's there and decide to do nothing. Which is pretty disgusting and definitely made me think twice about everywhere I sat.
The bathrooms were private and they had quiet a few on each floor. They didn't feel like they have been cleaned in a while. It was enough for what I had to do but i was in and out quickly.
They had free breakfast and dinner which was pretty good, free drink at the bar every night as well was a nice touch.
The people working here were nice and helpful as well.
I would stay here again if I needed a cheap place to stay cause everywhere in Victoria is pretty expensive and with the free food it made it worth it. But if you have some extra cash definitely try looking for an airbnb or something if what I said makes you uncomfortable. Here you get what you pay for.

The price was very reasonable, it is in a great location and includes free parking. It is within walking distance of downtown. We arrived early and our room wasn't ready but the let us leave our car in the parking lot while we explored the city.  There were a couple of cleanliness issues but nothing major and they were great about rectifying it when I talked to them.


The bed linens are not washed. Blood stains on the linen sheet. How did that get missed?!
If I didn’t flip the linen they probably wouldn’t even bother cleaning it for the next customer. Disgusting!

I will never ever recommend this place to anybody and don’t be fooled by the prices either. Too cheap to even do proper cleaning.

To make it even worse the bath tub is growing mold and the floor under the beds aren’t vacuumed. Key cards left under the bed by previous customers.

The photos don’t really do justice.

If I could give this place - 10 stars I definitely would. We didn’t sleep at all.


Conveniently located and friendly front desk staff. King beds were comfy. Room needed more thorough cleaning and maintenance. AC filter was so dirty that we cleaned it so that the AC would work. Bathtub drain was clogged. Bathroom fan was clogged with dirt. I don't recommend looking under the beds.


If you want a cheaper, budget friendly option for a hotel this would do the trick. The location was handy to get around downtown but you have to listen to the crazy loud street sounds that go with it. Sirens from emergency vehicles going off almost constantly, traffic, and people yelling outside.
The wifi is terrible, the connection was constantly cutting in and out. Light bulbs missing in the room. The room was dated but liveable, doesn't look like they tried too hard to pretty it up if you're looking for atmosphere. The floor I stayed on was crazy hot (but not downstairs on the lobby floor...), turned the air conditioner on full blast just to attempt to sleep at night but even then it was still hot. No screen on window which I feel should be an issue?  Staff were rather blah and unimpressive, they didn't seem very happy any time I spoke to them. All in all a decent option if you aren't going to spend a whole lot of time in the room, you can tolerate noise, and don't mind the most basic of basic places to stay.


Stayed here about two years ago now. Just here to rewrite my review as I’m pretty sure my original review was somehow removed. Cigarette holes in the mattress. Unsanitary. Woke up in the middle of the night with bed bugs crawling on me and my parents. Don’t believe the fake reviews. You’d be smart to stay far away from this place…

For the excellent location, big room, free coffee/ tea / water (a cup), friendly staffs, accessible to bus or ferry connector, etc. This 2 star hotel/ Inn is definitely a keeper on my list if I ever visit Victoria. Of course, just need to aware this is a kid and pet friendly place and therefore it could be noisy.  I would recommend this hotel/Inn to anyone who interested to visit Victoria.


I really like this hotel. Rooms are clean, the staff are friendly and it's in a great location. My only issue is it's loud. Walls are paper thin. If you're a deep sleeper or wear ear plugs you'll be ok. My last stay there were a group of guys in their 20s on my floor. I had a feeling it would be a long night. Needless to say it was very loud around 3am and the front desk needed to be called. I'm sure it's not always like this as it was a Saturday and the hotel is close to the bars. Other than that I've enjoyed my stay both times.


First of all no parking had to park on the street.. room was dirty. The bathtub had pubic hair on the side of the tub had hair and bugs inside the tub. Front desk employee had to come and wash the tub because there was no house keeping there.There was an earring stuck to side of the sink. The bed frame was sticking pass the mattress and cut my 70 year old moms leg open. The window had food stuck on  it and it was broken. The towel ra in bathroom was coming off the wall. As well the ceiling in the hallway had a big hole… not a fun night..


I assumed most well-known chain hotels would have air conditioning, but this one does not (and the windows only open a fraction). Do not stay here in hot temps (it hit 30 degrees today and our room is unbearable). For $250 a night, I would have hoped to be a comfortable temperature.

This is a budget hotel.  The front desk staff was very nice.  Bed and linen were decent and cleaned.  Bathroom was cleaned.  Found an old large plate with food in the microwave...gross! This is why I am giving 3 stars only.


I spent a week in Victoria in May with my husband, and we stayed at the Accent Inn on Maple street.  The service was impeccable and there is communication everywhere as to what amenities are available, who to contact and although we didn't need service, I felt the staff would be very attentive to any need.  The room was clean, and cleaned well during our stay, and the burger restaurant on site was great.  I would recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the Victoria area who wants to drive or take transit as it's not far from downtown and is in a great location!


The room was clean and very comfortable, and the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful!  The duck theming throughout the property was quirky, and definitely appreciated.  The housekeeping staff did an excellent job, and I was most impressed that this property offers a ""medical rate"" which helped us out financially.


Very friendly, nice staff. Beds were comfortable. Basic necessities ok. But it's an old-style motel that really needs to be upgraded or better yet, rebuilt. We only stayed there cause pets were allowed and it was fairly reasonable, though for a bit more, we could had a nicer hotel (without the dog)

Great room and staff…. wow what a hotel! The staff were so helpful and easy to talk to.
We found ourselves chatting up with them quite a bit about local sights and things to do. The room was clean and wonderfully appointed. The bar was very classy and unfortunately we did not have time to test the restaurant. From the photos I think it would have been marvelous. We will be back when we have more time and the Chateau Victoria will be our home away from home!


Absolutely fantastic!! The front staff were super nice and helpful, the room was spacious and I loved the set up they had with the two rooms, and the shower has to be the best shower in any hotel I’ve ever used.  I’m talking great water pressure and not those high pressure jets that eventually feel like they’re cutting into you, this shower was the perfect was to start my day.

The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of pillows and blankets.  The little kitchen was also very nice.

A great stay at a really good rate. :)


We visited Victoria to take in a concert at the Capital Ballroom, and chose the Chateau Victoria due to location and price. We definitely weren't disappointed. We only planned on staying one night, but we liked the hotel and the room (Deluxe Queen with bedroom and kitchen, Room 510) so much, that we decided to stay for three nights instead. This gave us a chance to explore Victoria and the surrounding area. The only complaints we have, is that the bed, although comfortable, was outdated and extremely squeaky. Every time I moved, the bed squeaked so badly that my wife woke up, and vice versa. My biggest complaint, however, is that there is a portable air conditioner in the bedroom that is used for the entire hotel room. The compressor on the unit is so incredibly LOUD that every time it kicked in or turned off, we woke up during the night. It was impossible for us to sleep while running the air conditioner and it couldn't be moved to the living room as it was permanently attached to the wall via the air vent. Often, in the middle of the night we had to wake up and turn off the air conditioner, open the window, and turn on the fan just to fall asleep. Therefore, in the 3 days we were at the hotel, we never had a good night's sleep because of the squeaky bed and the air conditioner. Great hotel, great service, great staff, absolutely loved it, but got zero sleep due to the noise of the bed and the air conditioner compressor. 5 stars for the hotel, 1 star for the bed and A/C. 3 stars overall based upon our lack of sleep.


Stayed here for the first time recently with my children. The location is fantastic, with so many dining options within walking distance and a stunning view of the harbour a 5 minute walk away. The staff were welcoming and helpful, and the cleanliness was top notch. The post-Covid return to daily room cleaning was so appreciated and the overall price was a bargain. This will be my hotel of choice without a doubt when I am next in Victoria.

The room was very comfortable and clean.

Pod coffee maker in room is nice.

Great location for bar hopping and sightseeing.

Decent view from some rooms at least.


Strathcona is a charming gem that exceeded my expectations. The hotel's thoughtful remodeling efforts, combined with its excellent location and welcoming staff, created an enjoyable and memorable experience. While it may not be ideal for families with little children, it offers a comfortable and convenient stay for travelers of all kinds. I highly recommend.


Great hotel, the beds were clean and comfortable, bathrooms were clean and well equipped. I actually prefer the laminate in the rooms instead of carpet. Good location in the centre of downtown with $10 surface parking. Only thing I didn't like was the view from the room, a brick wall.


Good hotel for the price. Not sure why they did laminate on the floors instead of carpet, which would be better at absorbing the stomping and clanking of noisy, inconsiderate neighbors. Best, most central location you could get without being directly on the waterfront. Didn't have much interaction with staff but they were friendly enough and made it easy to store bags before and after my stay. Nice lobby. Would stay again.


Great location for a great price. Room is very clean and quiet, and the person at the front desk was very helpful each time I interacted with them. Would definitely stay here again if I visit in the future.

We were group of 8 people and booked two rooms. We were playing music at night having our dinner. Then, Receptionist guy come in the room. He didn’t ask for the permission to enter the room, which was totally unacceptable. Then he just threatened us if you guys are not going to stop the music your both rooms will be seized (in very bad manner). I agree the music volume was high, we co-operate with guy. But the thing is he should ask us for permission to enter the room. The second thing he should warn us first or tell us that your music is loud, please stop it.

I know we were also at fault to play the loud music. But that person should know about ethics and customer service.


Had a very nice stay :) exactly what we expected for a reasonable price. Rooms were clean and comfortable and the staff were friendly and polite. Would definitely stay again!


We had a few of our guys stay at the Arbutus Inn for 2 weeks for a job they were doing in Victoria. We were so happy with the service and cleanliness of the hotel. We also appreciated Claudio the manager’s awesome service and all the stuff that he went above and beyond for us. Will use this hotel again in the future for sure!!


The walls were dirty and had holes in some of them.
The microwave in our room was old and didn't work properly.
The plates for the outlets were practically coming off the wall, I pulled out my cell charger and hafl the plate started to bend out.
The AC didn't work properly, At one point water started dripping out of it right on to an electrical wall heater.
The staff were very nice but this place needs a bit of an update.


It's too good to stay at. Rooms are very nice . Staff is very accommodating. Every happing place is around 20 - 25 minutes drive only

The location is great, close to downtown Victoria which is just across the bridge, the hotel is also right on the water and has some beautiful views. The beds are comfortable. The rooms are nice and very clean.


Hotel itself is nice and have a good view. However the service isn’t top tier. We are gold elite member and request for room upgrade. They staff said already upgraded to water view deluxe room but when we open the room and like excuse me???? Water view??? We feel being scammed!! We are disappointed because the view is obstructed. This is the UPGRADE they gave very good. Feels like downgrade for real. We arrive 3:30pm and they said they room isn’t ready yet. We are feel not good and our sense is true when we see the room they upgrade to us. First is low floor second there is not privacy at all with facing the street we have to keep curtain closed all time. Also we asking about club lounge access for gold elite member they front desk staff is not clear too and we are confused whether we can access or not then they just told me we can’t need to pay $60/night fee that’s totally different they they replied me in email. Feel not worth to stay here next time will find better hotels


We were gifted a suite on the 5th floor. Wow. The view of the harbour was incredible. We could walk out of the hotel and walk along the water.  The suite itself was large with a big living room separate from bedroom. The lounge access is wonderful. Soup, salads etc in evening then a great breakfast in the morning. It pays to be a Marriott member to earn points and get these perks. Parking is expensive. We parked to the side for free. No issues there.


Def a mixed bag experience. Location is great, views of the harbor are wonderful. However they struggled with American chip cards during check in, we don’t setup pins for credit card and the person checking me in was insistent. Eventually was manually entered but definitely sweating the entire time, and not the experience I’ve had with other Marriott properties, even lower tiers.

Rooms are a bit tired, carpet was coming up in some areas, but the bed is wonderful. Ultimately a generally comfortable hotel.


Had a family vacation here and had a really wonderful experience. Very ideally located - away from the downtown hustle and bustle but still very close and ocean view is simply amazing. Can get a superb view of the Legislative Building from the windows of the hotel. The staff is very courteous and helpful.

Place is a bit run down and not 100% clean. Side table, floors and toilet could have used a better wipe down. Kind of a strange set up with the huge tub in the middle of the room. Took forever to fill and then the jets didn’t work. Kitchen set up could be better by adding a counter and taking out the clothing rack. You are in an old house so you do hear other people easily but luckily all the other guests were quiet when I was there
But at the price, the location the wonderful bed and the garden view. I’d stay here again!


The deluxe family suite is without a doubt, the most wonderful home away from home we could hope for. Everything has exceeded expectations and we will definitely be back in the future. I highly recommend this gem.


It was was like visiting Europe with the old fashioned touches and brick. Lovely gardens. Unique suites named after artists. Our room


Both Cindy and Johnny were warm and welcoming! Our suite was goegeous with a large free standing tub. We came for snowmegeden 2022 and the paths were cleared by the time we woke up the morning which we greatly appreciated ! The location of this place is second to none its a 3 mim walk to the heart of the waterfront. Great for tourists !

Definitely recommend .


Stayed here for the first time and we’ll definitely be back! The views are stunning and the bed is incredibly comfortable and luxurious. The location is awesome as it is still a short walk to the busy inner harbour and rest of downtown but it is also tucked away from the bustle and thus a perfect spot for a peaceful getaway. They are also pet friendly and gave me a nice room on the ground floor looking out over the Japanese garden and inner harbour. So it was easy to take my pooch out for a walk. Definitely excited to return!


Well this was a one night stay at this hotel. When i checked in and went to the room, there was a  vacuum blocking the door (Strange that the cleaners/maids would leave that there). There was nothing special about this room. Especially for the price they were charging. The bathroom had an old 1970s bathtub (only 6"" deep) and a shower head that was too low. The shampoo and such things were bolted to the wall, and it was cheap shampoos. The air conditioning/heating unit was old and loud, something you might again find in a 1970s hotel. I have stayed at high-end hotels all over the world, and I was extremely disappointed by this hotel. There is a swimming pool, no hot tub, no steam room, no sauna. The website said it was open till 12 midnight, but when I arrived to go for a swim at 11pm, it was closed, and the sign on the door said closed at 10pm. The exercise room was small, I wanted to go for a run in the morning only to find there was no treadmill ???.
Before I checked in, I went to the restaurant for a bite to eat, disappointing  again. I ordered a $19 burger, didn't come with any sides??? Just a burger.  A small bowl of French fries for an extra $11 ??? My friend had ordered a Pale Ale, and I ordered a Lager.  We both received Pale Ales. Again, for the price they were charging for this hotel, I was expecting something luxurious and satisfying.
I could hear people snoring in the next room and had a terrible sleep.
I was extremely disappointed. I would never stay here again, and I would highly recommend anyone else to do more research before staying here.
The only thing that was good was the location. Otherwise, this hotel reminded me of a Motel 6 ($40/night). I paid over $500 for 1 night. I did mention  something to the front desk, only to get a response ""Oh thats too bad"", ""thank you for staying with us"".


Good location with ocean view, the most overpriced for traditional room, poor amenities, and food. Service is not to satisfy and delight customers. Paid $1000 for 1 room, 2 double beds, 2 nights, not worth money and time. The weather is great though


We had a sumptuous gastronomic experience at the Inn's Aura Restaurant. We ordered the crispy pork banh mi and The Point burger, and they were absolutely delicious for the price of $18 and $20 respectively. And the view from the restaurant is just spectacular! Small amphibian planes touching the water and yachts are just a few of the eye candies! They have a gorgeous garden too! It's a short walking distance from the nearest bus stop--Superior at Montreal

Close to the Clipper dock and is just a few minutes walking to the downtown area.  The hotel building and grounds are well kept. Our room was clean and well maintained.  No visible wear and tear. The breakfast buffet dining room is only accessible by stairs, there might have been another way in, but it was not obvious to me.  The food was well stocked with a variety of fruits, cereal, breads, eggs, meat, potatoes and yogurt.  The staff are friendly and helpful.

Just one cautionary item: if you need to exchange US dollars,  they will not give you the going exchange rate. This is the first time I ever encountered that scenario in BC.

We recommend this as a place to stay.


This was my second time stay at this hotel. Everything is perfect. Rooms quality, room rent, proximity to harbor front, tourist places, parking, morning breakfasts. Staff is very friendly. I mentioned that I am bringing my family for celebrating birth and as a sweet gesture they put a chocolates in the room, they also upgraded our breakfast to pendry’s breakfast which was an amazing experience. You will love this place. I definitely coming for one more time.  Thank you for giving us amazing experience.


The hotel is in a great location. You can walk the downtown area and many places. The service is wonderful. Everyone is nice and friendly. The food at the breakfast buffet has a variety of options, and the quality is great. The place is clean and cozy. The beds are comfortable. It's also quiet so you can relax and have a downtime and get a good night's sleep. The room and furniture just need some updating. It's outdated, but other than that, we had a wonderful stay and experience.


My husband and I stayed here for a short visit during Christmas.  We booked a loft room and loved how much space we had and the kitchen.  The breakfast buffet was delicious.  Rooms were very clean. Would book here again with out a second thought.


The staff is extremely friendly, hospitable and professional from their front-end to back-end employees.

Our complimentary breakfast was delicious, offering a wide range of items. It can get busy during peak breakfast hours, but the staff is always accommodating in helping find a table for you right away. They also do an exceptional job keeping the buffet-style breakfast stations clean and tidy.

The room was very well kept and clean. This is obviously an older building, so noise transfer from room to room is very noticeable. Unfortunately, this was an oversight by the guests above our suite, but the hotel management was quick to offer a solution for us to move into another suite that was much quieter. I appreciated this so much as I am a very light sleeper and really sensitive to noise.

The manor is within walking distance to downtown Victoria, Chinatown and many different attractions, so I was able to leave my vehicle in the hotel's secured underground parking and didn't have to deal with Victoria's paid street parking.

I'm looking forward to coming back here as it was affordable, clean, and I felt very well looked after by the staff, but will likely request a suite on the top floor to get a more consistent quiet experience.

The Starbucks in the lobby is very handy.  Location is perfect and close to everything downtown. Special thanks to the very friendly and welcoming valet and breakfast/restaurant staff. As a Diamond member, the complimentary room upgrade is often well worth it, as the hotel has some lovely spacious suites and rooms with phenomenal views.


While on the island I chose to stay at the DoubleTree Hilton in Victoria. It is located only minutes from the waterfront and and restaurants downtown.

The hotel itself is nice with a smaller lobby. Staff was friendly and service was prompt. Upon checking in they give patrons a warm freshly baked cookie.

The room was nothing extraordinary but was clean and spacious. The bed was comfortable and the room I stayed in had a shower without a tub.

A breakfast buffet is also available and a restaurant and Starbucks are also accessible from the lobby.

Suites are available as well with balconies. A gym is also located in the hotel.

Parking is only valet unless you want to park in the upper open lot. Parking fees still apply either way.

If you do stay here opt for a higher floor with a waterfront view I would imagine it would be ideal for looking out into the horizon.


Amazing, amazing experience in this hotel! It’s conveniently located in the heart of downtown, close to bus stops, and a Starbucks in the lobby. Service was SUPERB: from being greeted by 2 of the front desk staff, whom I had asked to store my luggage away as we had arrived there earlier than supposed check in (so we took this opportunity to go around the city), being helped by Herbert (?) at the reception when checking in (guys, he is AWESOME! Very welcoming, friendly, and will go out of his way to offer you the best room!), and getting room service for breakfast! The room we had was luxurious and had the best view! I do wish they had a pool as it would have been nice to finish off a long day of touring, but it’s not a big deal. I’m definitely still staying here again when I visit Victoria next time around! 😁


Can’t begin to tell y’all how much we loved staying here. Every single thing about this property is admirable. First and foremost, the staff and their services are just top notch.From front desk to breakfast, housekeeping or the valet, everybody was just so pleasant, kind and helpful. We loved our previous stays and that’s the reason we chose this property and most certainly it was very pleasant experience. Thank you so much for lovely treatment 🙏


Had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  Winona at the front desk was very pleasant and we were able to check-in at 11am.  When we arrived to our floor, housekeeping was there to greet us.  Bambi introduced herself to us and said if we needed anything to let her know.  Our room was clean and spacious with views of the city.  There is a starbucks off the lobby with a fireplace and a nice cozy restaurant adjacent to the hotel. We will def come back and stay there again!

The restaurant has a great view but the food was less than good! I would have to say sad!!
Location is great though.


Hotel seems old and has that old ""I've been on the harbour for 20 years"" smell. Not gross at all, just not fresh and new. Rooms are tight but very clean. Full bathroom and we had a little fridge and extra sink. Awesome location as it's right by the legislative assembly and museum etc.


The hotel is in desperate need of an update.  It gets to the point where no matter how good your staff are, getting the place properly clean with cracks and such isn’t possible.   Floors are uneven, rooms are smelly, and the noise isn’t a joke.  The restaurant in the hotel is mediocre at best.  Desk staff were very friendly.  Cleaning staff was kind.  Manager was micromanaging everything and we were embarrassed by changes she made making people run around unnecessarily.  Absolutely a 1.5 star hotel in a 5 star location.


Great location. I liked the pub on the main floor, though, there are lots of better options within walking distance. Avoid staying on the second floor (directly above the pub) and bring ear plugs. The sound insulation for the hotel, overall, is very poor. I could clearly hear the normal volume conversation of the people staying in the adjacent room, and, I presume, they could equally easily hear us.

There are lots of other hotels in the vicinity, and this one seems to get a low rating in comparison to the others. I would suggest looking around for a different hotel in the area, if you are able. Loved the easy walking access to the Victoria restaurant district, though.


As soon as we entered the room we could smell the floor cleaning chemical. Maybe housekeeping just cleaned it before the check in time but it was so hard to breathe with that pungent smell. We had to keep the windows open for couple hours to get rid of it. Otherwise the location is great and staff was friendly and welcoming especially the brown guy on the reception.

Booked a very special Milestone Birthday for my wife this May and keyed in on the location of this Hotel. Although a little dated, it has been well renovated, is very bright and very clean. I booked a package through Expedia (Air, Hotel, Car Rental, etc) then went directly to the Property to upgrade. Staff were fantastic and did everything to make sure this was a very special occasion. The upgrade was inexpensive but what was delivered can only be described as outrageous! Full  1bdrm Penthouse Suite with over 500sqft of Patio over looking the Harbour. Full Kitchen, Full size living room, 4pce bath plus jetted tub and an outdoor enclosed gazebo with 2 sided fireplace into a full size living room. We walked just about everywhere and did a couple water tours (Victoria Harbour Ferry) plus the Butchart Gardens. One of our favourite places to eat was JR Slims, right across the street from Main entrance. The best Nachos were
through the basement on the water side in Lido Waterfront. The Red Fish Blue Fish had huge lineups so if you are walking around early in the day go hungry and go early. This was an Incredible trip and an incredible property. Major brownie points with the missus.

I have stayed at this charming boutique hotel in the past and had a fantastic experience. This time, the stay was very, very disappointing. The room was freezing cold, yet the description of the room clearly states there is no AC, not no heat. Also, the delicious breakfast was no longer included (yet the descriptions say free breakfast), the room and other areas were dirty, the coffee and hot water decanters downstairs were not refilled, and the shower head fell down and injured my daughter. Don’t expect to be able to plug in your devices either as there is only 1 wall outlet for lamps, fans, and heaters. For these reasons, I feel the high room rates are not justified, and I no longer recommend this hotel.


We had a wonderful stay. We had the master suit and it had its own little kitchen so we’re able to bring home our leftovers from all the yummy restaurants we ate at. We loved sitting in the common room after our walk downtown. The view is breathtaking and it was nice and quiet.
Anyone complaining about the water temperature never grew up in a house with many people, sometimes you need to wait for it to heat up or just get up early.
We will be back.


I stayed two nights in March 2023. Great homey B'n'B. Helpful and friendly staff. Super clean establishment! Downtown is in walking distance (15min walk). Quite and historic neighbourhood with quite some huge sequoia trees. Highly recommended.


It's very charming and unique. Kind of like a B&B but more private. Can't beat the backyard being the Castle! It's a unique experience but not a typical hotel FYI.

The rooms are beautiful, clean and we have a harbor view and balcony with stunning views of the yachts, boat taxis and pontoon planes. Beautiful town skyline views. The front desk staff were nice but not overly helpful or friendly. They seemed put out at having to wait on us.


We stayed in April for an event. It’s very nice and convenient for the purpose of our visit.
The room itself is pretty nice and updated with plenty of cabinets. The soaker tub is also great. We had a room in the back of the building which is pretty chill and quiet. The elevator is pretty fast too. We asked for toothbrush and slippers which was sent to our room.

Cons: The room was pretty cold to my liking. There’s a maximum temperature one can set but it also warms up only a specific area of the room and can’t make the whole room warm enough.
The bed is a bit firm.
The towels and bath robes are quite rough  - maybe a bit old and need replacement.
Not enough coffee pods were provided for the length of our stay. I had to constantly ask for it.

Overall, we had a great stay.


I had my parents stay at Hotel Grand Pacific. The room has a lovely view, and the amenities at the hotel were great. Many walkable places to explore from the hotel. Dinner at Fathom was outstanding!
My parents would like to give special thanks to Troy and Sunho for making their stay comfortable and extra special!!


We have booked a bay view suite for the weekend. The room is quite large and the facilities are very nice, we look forward to our weekend here and are excited to try the restaurant downstairs. The front desk staff were very helpful as well as very professional. Big plus for being very central and a quick trip just about anywhere.

Gratefully, J & M


Stayed here back in August 2017. This hotel is awesome. The staff were friendly, the rooms were beautiful, and the location was close to a bus stop and in walking distance of shops. It was a good 3-day stay. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a cheaper hotel to stay at while in Victoria.


Rooms are clean and spacious with a modern TV. The staff is nice and they offer regular cleaning. Great place for kids and it is in a good location.
Only few comments, my plane was at 8 and the staff wouldn't let me stay beyond 11:30. An hour or two would have been nicer. And a bottle of water and some coffee in the room would have made it more pleasant. You wouldn't feel like taking a walk to the reception every time you need a cup.


We stayed in the cottage at The Zed Victoria. The cottage was clean, had a full kitchen, and was surprisingly quite at night.

We enjoyed the pool and hot tub.

Walking distance to food and downtown.

Staff were friendly and helpful.

Definitely where we’ll stay on our next trip to Victoria!


We are so happy that we found this place! This will be our spot from here on out! The rooms are so cool and retro! Got to practice our Yo-Yo skills in our room, beautiful area and right beside a mall and close to the downtown core!
The staff are so helpful and even let us leave our luggage while we waited for our bus at the end of the day after check out. Could not recommend this place more! You are kissing out if you let this pass!

I really liked a lot about this hotel, and I will definitely highlight the pros, but I want to quickly discuss my concerns first. Although I only have two concerns with this property, I believe they are significant.

The first, as mentioned, is that there is no air-conditioning. Now this is not something I even check for in a hotel - it's like colour TV. I was SHOCKED when we got in and I read a note about their environmental initiatives which include no air conditioning. Ten years ago, you would not have needed air condition in Victoria, but that is sadly no longer that case. And I do understand the irony of criticizing this hotel for their carbon positive policies when climate change is the one causing these increased temperatures. I was so glad we were there the week after a heat wave and we were okay. I would return to this hotel, and recommend it to others, only in the months of October to March for this reason.

The second is a safety concern. Because of the lack of AC, they had the windows open in our room upon arrival. Now this is another thing I'm not used to. I pretty much never open windows in a hotel room, and I'm certainly not expecting them to be opened for me. Because of the quiet street, it took me awhile to even notice that they were open. Once I saw the high up windows letting in the fresh air, I thought that seemed nice. What I was alarmed to notice later was the floor-level windows, which were also open in such a way that my eight-month old baby could have easily crawled right out. They knew we had a baby since we requested a crib, and still left these windows open. They were slightly behind the sofa, so I didn't spot them until my son was crawling in their direction, and I was horrified. I'm honestly not sure how that would pass any kind of safety requirements.

Like I said, two significant concerns, but otherwise it is truly a beautiful property. We received EXCELLENT service from everyone we interacted with at the hotel. The rooms are spacious and comfortable. The koi pond and lobby are stunning. The cafe/bar on site is delicious. The location is convenient. We happily made use of the washer/dryer (more of a washer than a dryer as with most combo machines) and dishes in our suite. Overall the property feels luxurious for a reasonable price. If you are travelling to Victoria in Oct/Nov/Dec/Jan/Feb/Mar, I would very much recommend The Parkside.


The Pros: Beautiful hotel, beautiful, spacious, and well-appointed rooms, excellent housekeeping. Coffee & teas were top-notch and real cream was offered. Lots of kitchen-wares, they were spotless and came in very handy during my stay. Small washing machine was very useful.
Hotel was a hot-spot for seasonal parties and events which made for a fun atmosphere, though at times the lobby gets quite crowded.
Pool was very clean and well maintained.
Most staff were excellent - especially Briyana at the front desk. Hotel offers very good government rates.
Location is close to many restaurants, which I recommend, as the attached cafe offered few over-priced options that were not well prepared.

The Cons:
The bed was uncomfortably firm, I requested an extra duvet to sleep on top of as I had a longer stay. Low shower/water pressure, likely a green initiative.
Very poor communications and follow-through among client service team resulted in chaos and frustration come billing time. Billing issues were ultimately sorted out after more than a week and several phone calls. The finance manager was apologetic and helpful, and made every effort to make things right once issues were brought to her attention.


Hotel was beautiful!  The suite had everything!  A kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, walk in closet, living room, fireplace, washing machine!  The pool was great, I didn’t have time for the spa but I wish I did!  Underground parking was convenient although came with an added fee.  I would 100% stay again.  Thank you Parkside Victoria!


A-1 friendly staff. The hotel's cafe is really good. Just make sure there is nothing of value in your vehicle when you park in the underground lot. That includes the street the hotel is located. Smash and grab nearly weekly in this particular block of Humboldt. I know this because I've lived next to the hotel for over ten years. Pets are allowed!


My partner and I decided to treat ourselves and debated for some time if we should; we finally decided we would go for it, only to be quite disappointed with a lacklustre couples massage. We both agreed we had better massages in Asia which cost us only $10 in comparison. Part of the reason we chose Parkside as well, was for the hot tub use, which turned out to be broken, nothing of which was mentioned. Would recommend elsewhere if you do opt to try and treat yourself, definitely not worth it.

The laid-back inmates and the service of the friendly staff created a very homely atmosphere.
We absolutely loved the complimentary coffee in the morning. The snack machine upstairs and the restaurant and pub downstairs were convenient.
We are eagerly looking forward to our next stay.


This is a beautiful, old hotel with vintage furnishings. My room was beautiful and spacious. The bathroom was SPOTLESS clean. The staff were super friendly and accommodating. There is a cafe AND a bar on the ground floor. It is in an amazing area; so close to beacon hill park and Dallas road. I will definitely stay there again!!!


Lovely boutique-style hotel in a beautiful 112 year old building. Totally not haunted. The architecture and design are very interesting and they use all the space very well. Free ice and cheap vending machines on site. Pub, kitchen, and cafe in the basement.

The king size room we stayed in had a shower with two heads, one on each side. Beautifully furnished with a classical charm that hasn't been the norm for a long time. Absolutely would stay again.


This is a quaint, homey place to stay. We were in the cottages. It was a great sleep, clean, and the customer services was fantastic. Thanks for making us feel so welcomed. With the cottages - you’re in an old house so you’ll occasionally hear others moving around. Didn’t bother us! Better than the “big chain hotels” around the city.


My husband and I stayed here for one night on Valentines as we were having dinner at the restaurant here. They gave us a very nice corner room on the top floor and we had a nice view. Also there is a balcony on the second and third floors for guests to use and there are chairs and tables out there. We enjoyed sitting out there with a glass of wine before dinner. Beds were comfortable as well. Ice water, coffee and tea are served in the lobby as well.

We were able to enjoy the facilities without feeling cramped or crowded and enjoyed the spaciousness of the room we had. Super convenient central location and able to walk the marina boardwalk and walk your pets right outside the entrance. Staff were all very kind and accommodating. Would visit again !


Excellent hotel! Incredible staff, great location right across the street from the harbor. The rooms were clean and classy. The bathrooms were bright and featured a really nice shower. Traditional tea service for lunch was delicious! Dinner and drinks at the restaurant were incredible!
Book through me and you'll get perks! Early check in/late check out, upgrade when available, hotel credit, daily breakfast for 2.


The rooms are very tastefully updated with some traditional features. They are spacious for an older hotel. The service from the moment we parked to check-in to getting into the room was exceptional. Everyone we dealt with was very professional and helpful. The Location is what sets it apart, with a young family to get up and go was very easy. The amenities are great, the spa, pool and fitness center.

The grounds are immaculate, you can just enjoy the landscaping and scenery.

We had drinks at the restaurant it was a vibe, the live music, crafted drinks really made it enjoyable. The shops are busy and on the far side of the hotel, great to check out.

Don't look at the cost of the room but the convivence of the location, the amenities that are offered. I would highly recommend for young families and anyone who wants to go out and explore Victoria and come back to the hotel for a rest and then go out again. Its so centrally located that you're able to make the most of your time.


The room was spacious and comfortable with a great view of the bay. The building maintains a historic feel without coming off as dated. The staff was extremely professional and nice with all interactions. Couldn't be in a more convenient walking location in terms of food/touristy spots nearby.


We stayed here while in town attending a friends wedding. I was on crutches at the time & the helpfulness of the staff was incredible.
The rooms are spacious, clean, quiet & comfortable.
The location is perfect.
The food & drinks were top of the line.

I will definitely be back !

Ruby's next door is a great place for breakfast and prices are reasonable. The rooms are on the smaller side (NYC size) but they are well appointed and freshly updated. I'd easily stay here again. Even better, the service can't be beat! Everyone was just so nice!


A gem of a hotel if you can manage a little bit of noise. My husband was working out of town in Victoria so my son and I decided to tag along and get a vacation out of it at the same time. The hotel location is amazing. It is walking distance to basically everything. It is located on a busier street so you can hear the road noise in your room. The hotel is aware of this and kindly provides earplugs for those this may affect. My son is 7 months old and the noise did not disrupt his sleep or routine. I personally did not find the noise too bad.
The staff at this hotel was incredible. They were all beyond kind. The parking arrangement is valet only and they always had my husbands truck ready to go for him every morning. Super quick and efficient if we hadn’t previously scheduled it…however with everything in walking distance we didn’t find we used it in the evening.
The room was clean and had everything provided. House cleaning is based on request instead of everyday…which worked well for our situation.


I recommend staying here if you want to receive excellent customer service! We hadn't been to beautiful Victoria since before the pandemic. We decided to take the Clipper with hope that we could truly enjoy the experience of not having to drive and be centrally nearby points of interest. This Hotel offered that to us. The room, our view, and the staff were also great! The staff was very gracious about storing our luggage while we had a short wait for our room to be ready. We had arrived before noon. They texted us to let us know when the room was ready. They also extended check out for us, and stored our luggage again while we had a late breakfast in the restaurant that is attached to the Hotel. The staff even called a taxi for us to take back to the Clipper ferry. We were treated very well.  We are looking forward to our next trip back!


Smack in downtown, which is great! Room that was given to us was clean and neat (King + Sofa). Noise insulation from street was also decent. Restrooms were clean and furnished with the basic amenities. The staff was polite and quick. Also thing to note is that parking is Valet and could take 15 minutes or so for them to get your car out. Price paid for the room was slightly higher than expected, but would stay again based on cleanliness and the location.


Located perfectly 10 min walk from harbour, in the downtown, Stuff, service is absolutely Awesome!! A  Specially thanks to manager Nadine- excellent people skills !!! Front desk guys- Brenton, Jessica, Steve.. and more.. excellent messaging system, we had agreement on free parking- but otherwise parking is expensive!! Hotel super clean and comfortable!! Definitely will stay again

I will definitely be recommending the hotel to friends and family.


Hands down the best hotel I’ve ever stayed at. Perfect for our honeymoon! You absolutely get what you pay for. Even the cheapest room was extremely well furnished, with an amazing bathroom and jacuzzi tub. The facilities are top-notch, especially the mineral pool and hot tubs. Breathtaking views as well! If you have a car, booking through Oak Bay is a good deal for free parking. A bit out of the way from downtown, but that can also be a positive. We will be back soon!


Stayed for a girls weekend and had the best time! Our room was beautiful, the beds were so comfortable, the view was fabulous. The hotel made sure we had everything we needed for our furry four-legged friend as well which was amazing. Dillon helped us and was absolutely fantastic and made the stay even more memorable - cannot say enough good things about him! We are already planning our next trip!


Beautiful hotel with stunning ocean views and great customer service. Sadly the eucalyptus steam room was closed and drinks aren’t allowed in the pool but the room amenities are excellent and the beds are very comfortable. Lee the valet was lovely as was Dalton and Shannon and the other lady (can’t recall her name) at the front desk were also terrific.


Lovely stay, large and gorgeous rooms. The pools and especially the views were lovely.

I will say security/cleanliness at the pools could be a bit tighter. We got in the pools first thing and there were dirty cups from the night before still on the deck. And the next evening - someone took my friends robe and the first staff member seemed unperturbed by it.

Overall the beauty of the place outweighed the negatives.

The team were friendly and helpful. Our room was very spacious and clean, in addition we received a complimentary upgrade from a Queen to King bed suite. I was surprised at how comfortable the bed was and how relaxing the shower was - great water pressure.

Like Victoria, the hotel has an old world charm and was well maintained, both interior and exterior. The location was amazing and central, 1/2 block from The Parliament and in the heart of the famed Inner Harbour - we walked everywhere with ease. We would highly recommend this hotel and it was a wonderful experience for our family. Thanks for the memorable stay!


We have stayed here many many times over the years.
The rooms are very well kept and comfortable.
The convenience of the hotels location make it easy to go in any direction on foot or by cab/car.
What really stands out is the friendly staff, in every position at the hotel. They make me smile and feel welcomed.
We will keep coming back as long as it stays open, for the comfort and ease of the staying here. This has been a special place for us and will continue to be.


Stayed here with my family, it is an older property but very well maintained. It is clean and very cozy with a nice dividing wall between sleeping and tv/kitchen area. Halls were clean and quiet. I loved how quiet it was on the balcony.  The hotel is near the harbor but away from the noise of the main street. Good walking distance to the Harbour and downtown. Restaurant is clean and cozy with good food and service. Kids enjoyed the pool. Would definitely stay here again.


April 3-6, 2023.  Great find for a moderately priced hotel within easy walking distance to the Victoria Clipper.  Friendly staff, particularly Kevin who provided shuttle service when I was too pooped to walk to my next destination.  Room was well appointed.  I didn’t get to use the pool, but was impressed at how clean it appeared to be.  So few folks shower before a dip, which is why I typically avoid hotel pools.  The on-site restaurant provided a nice breakfast too!


Beautiful hotel, it is so elegant and the room was so big, also it is located in a really good place you could go almost everywhere by walking. It is so clean and the employees are so kind and friendly. It has a jacuzzi, pool and game room, it is so comfortable! I recommend it!

Food was fast and delicious , view is spectacular. Would recommend staying here ! Or just stop by for food and drinks.


Really enjoyed our overnight stay. Booked 3 rooms as our family came over and we all enjoyed the hotel. The bidet was unusual but we ended up liking it! And the best part was how responsive the front desk was with the texting option. Allowed me to tell them our approx check in time (slightly early, which they accommodated and check out time, we needed slightly later and they allowed that too). Plus everyone was super helpful. I wish the restaurant was open for dinner on a Tues night (but hubby enjoyed breakfast there on Wed morn) and other than that - a really good stay.


Great experience, beautiful location (right on the water), clean rooms & facilities and friendly staff. The prices were fair here and the views of the marina were an added bonus. It was a seamless process from check-in to check-out and I would certainly return. It was great to have the use of their pool, whirl pool, sauna and gym too. They offer a free shuttle and the driver is super friendly. The only reason I haven’t given 5 stars is because the building and rooms are a bit dated and could use a refresh in the future. But in terms of cleanliness, price and location - no complaints at all.


great weekend in Victoria - this is by far the best hotel we've stayed in for the price in Vic. Location is perfect, the staff at the front is amazing and the restaurant (Blue Crab) is great. Really clean rooms and spacious for all of our gear we were travelling with. Can't believe the price we got for it - honestly better than we expected! We loved the warm pool and hot tub too. We're staying here again when we visit and we recommend you do too!


Great service! My room had a beautiful view. The bidet toilets were amazing! I didn’t use the pool but it looked amazing. The hot tub was great. One of the treadmills was out of order but I was in the gym alone and used the other one. All the equipment looked fine. The restaurant was great but slightly pricey. They have a driver that can take you downtown Victoria, which is such a plus. There is also this famous neighborhood cat that hangs out in the lobby. So cute! I will definitely book here when I come back to Vic.

Excellent hotel right in the heart of downtown Victoria. Hotel was clean, had a neat restaurant/bar, bed was very comfy and bathroom floor was heated!

Will be staying here next time I'm in Victoria.


Overall it was lovely but it would have been nice to see anything other than another persons window outside ours. Can’t win em all and we booked for location over a view so I won’t even minus a star for that. Free coffee in the morning was much appreciated and loved being close to Chinatown and Fan Tan Alley.

Speaking of rooms. OMG. We stayed in the Somerset room which had a balcony, an amazing and huge bathroom with a lounge tub, which was so nice to use after a long day.
The complimentary breakfast was so delicious and had a great view of the ocean and a dog park. Does it get any better than that??
Oh, and I can't forget how beautiful and well maintained the garden was! As well as lots of parking provided, although we chose to park our large truck beside Beacon Hill Park across the street which was still no charge.

Honestly one of the best experiences we've ever had!!! The location is amazing!!! We were on the main floor and had a spectacular view!!

In lobby, complimentary Coffee making machine & drinking water facilities are praise worthy. The Gentleman at reception was very courteous. Looking to come back again next time in Victoria. Keep it up ………


I stayed on the third floor (308)this weekend with my fiancé and two kids. We were so disappointed how outdated and grungy the room was. It did not have ac and stunk. Friday night we smelled smoke and I let the front desk politely know. They didn’t even apologize, just said let them know if I smell it again. The cooked breakfast food tasted like freezer burn. It was just not a good visit. The hotel is in a great location, but definitely will not be returning.


Great hotel! Price was very reasonable and the amenities we great, good breakfast, nice little pool in the back garden, and kitchenette in the room was awesome.

Nice place for the whole family with Parliament just next door.
Wish I had this hotel/experience during the bulk of my vacations. Clean room that comes with a mini kitchen that even has pots/pans (even though I'm not comfortable using public things it's still great to see it's available). Slightly narrow room but nothing to complain about.
Serious props to all the staff and the head chef I believe watching the food area. Amazing breakfast (probably the best breakfast I had in a hotel so far that isn't 4-5 stars), accommodating and polite staff at the desk, and awesome free hot chocolate at the machine. No complaints during my stay.


I am returning from 6 weeks in resorts in Mexico and decided to stay in Victoria for a few nights before returning home. The Embassy Inn room was as comfortable - although smaller - as the resort hotels I stayed in. Very clean. Large bar fridge. Microwave oven. Safe. There are lots of outlets for charging devices. Comfortable Beds.  Their continental breakfast service is good. It is right in James Bay and close to downtown - very walkable.


Very pleased with our stay. Great location, comfy bed, and amazing breakfast! Free parking and we were able to bring our pup along as well. I’d stay here again!


Very awesome place! Breakfast is complete with scramble eggs and meats and etc. The parking is free and wifi is consistant at 40 to 100 mbps depending when. Staff was very very accommodating and help us a lot! Location is absolutely best. You can walk to everything. The room looks older a bit but bathroom recently renovated and it was very very clean everywhere in the room and the hotel.

The front desk staff were extremely helpful and pleasant when we completed the check in and check out. Our room was spotless and had some extra unexpected touches like complimentary slippers and bottled water. The beds and room furniture was also fantastic and comfortable! The breakfast buffet is also not be missed, they had everything you could need (quick oats, cereal, hot baked goods, coffee machine with alternate hot drink options like hot chocolate and lattes, and fresh fruit). Definitely recommend and will be staying here again in the future!


We just finished a 30 day long term stay at Robin Hood and it was a very pleasurable experience. The staff are very helpful and supportive. Sam is particularly welcoming.
The Great room with its amenities is fun and we especially enjoyed the complimentary breakfast (special thanks to Vivian and Darren).
The location is great, so close to wonderful walks along the Gorge. We used the e-bikes several times and it was so easy to get to the galloping goose trail.
The rooms are spotless, the beds comfy and the toiletries are top quality.


Lovely stay. The service is simply beyond words. Way better than many 5-star hotels in many ways.
Bed was super comfy and the room was clean and spacious.  Breakfast was delicious. Toiletries were of good quality and even included make up remover wipes. Complimentary kayak and e-bike were really good. We had great fun. Free shuttle was readily available.
Special shout out to Sam, Gloria, Lucas, Pink, Vivian, Sid for your warm welcome, good recommendations, yummy breakfast, smiles, most of all super grateful to all for your help to find my husband's phone and insisted to deliver the phone to us even when we were in inner harbour. You have saved our holiday which would be completely ruin if he had lose his phone!
Thanks again for making our stay such a wonderful one and going the extra mile.
Highly recommends anyone to stay at Robin Hood and will definitely be back!!!


Great hotel to stay in! Went to Victoria in early spring exactly during the cherry blossom season and enjoyed our stay in the hotel surrounded by flowering trees. The location is pretty good as well, you can walk to the downtown for just 30 min, enjoying the views of the harbour! The shuttle delivered us from the airport directly to the hotel, which was really nice. The staff was always very helpful and friendly (even when I had trouble dealing with laundry, but in the end it worked perfectly!). Complimentary breakfasts made a very good start for the day with delicious fresh pastries, yogurt and variety of choices for tea/coffee. The great room has a billiard, table soccer and many board games, which is a good thing to play in the rainy evening. Separate appreciation to the complimentary e-bikes, we really enjoyed cycling up to Mount Douglas Park (highly recommended to visit).


I had the pleasure of enjoying breakfast at this establishment, and I must say, the selection of bread and fruit was delightful. The array of choices available ensured that there was something to please every palate.

One aspect that truly stood out to me was the exceptional service provided by Vivian, Sian, and Darren. Their kindness and warm smiles created a welcoming atmosphere that made my breakfast experience even more enjoyable. It's clear that the staff takes pride in their work and genuinely cares about the satisfaction of their guests.

Overall, I highly recommend this place for a satisfying stay experience. From the delicious food options to the outstanding service, it's a delightful way to start the day.

I thought wrong! am voluntarily writing this review out of good will and because the hotel is wonderful. We just got back from staying at Four Seasons in Whistler and I can actually say that his hotel is even more comfortable than Four Seasons. It’s clean, rooms are big and comfortable, location is great and most of all, the staff are all genuinely nice. This must come from management so I can’t say enough good things for how this hotel is being managed. Love everything about it and so happy to be here. Five starts for sure!!! I will be recommending this place to anyone who is interested in coming to visit Victoria. The bar downstairs is also so lively! We have an eight year old with us and we all had a great experience with the staff for after dinner drinks.


We had an amazing stay. The building is older, but the rooms seem very modern. High quality niceties such as Dyson hair dryer, bubble bath in the bathroom, Nespresso coffee machine and Silk Road tea in room right beside a sink. We checked in during the evening and there was even a welcoming glass of white wine in the lobby. Drip coffee and tea available there as well! Wish we could have stayed longer.


This hotel is incredibly nice and all the staff give excellent service. We stayed on the top floor; the room was boujee and every touch luxurious. The bed was really comfortable; a firm mattress but the kind your body thanks your for. We both slept like babies even though I have a hard time sleeping in most hotel beds.
I highly recommend staying here. The spa is also amazing and the restaurant has top notch food and cocktails (and of course incredible service).


Great place to stay in Victoria! Friendly staff, highly clean rooms and fancy toiletries! Bath robe is worth having, should have bought it. Very convenient location to walk around the town, places to visit. And they have a charging station for electric vehicles. I used paid valet parking.


I cannot say enough good things about The Magnolia Hotel! I am a bit of a germaphobe and our room was extremely clean, spacious, quiet, and well-equipped (fluffy robes, Dyson brand hair dryer and all attachments, L'Occitane toiletries). The staff is exceptionally friendly and hospitable. The location is perfect, with most everywhere we wanted to see/visit/dine at within walking distance. The staff cleaned our room each day as a rule and provided fresh towels and face cloths more than once per day if we required, without us ever needing to ask. The nightly turn-down service with chocolates was such a lovely touch! We had our young daughter with us and she was treated with the utmost respect. This hotel provided excellent value and I would 100% recommend it over other luxury hotel brands.

We come every 6 weeks or so. The staff are always helpful, breakfast is exceptional, the rooms are quirky, unique and comfortable. Very soft sheets. Always clean :)


The owner of this place is lovely. She is so sweet and helpful with everything. Place had adorable decor!


I visited here for my vacation and it was absolutely amazing. I got the garden room and I'm so glad I did. The room as an outside entrance which makes it perfect if you come back late or want to leave early without disturbing to many people or if you just want to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the fresh air. The breakfast was perfect and I loved the decor of the whole place. Gave it a more welcoming feel than a traditional hotel. The staff members were also extremely friendly and helpful. I definitely recommend staying here. I know I will the next time I come up.

It was kind of like what if you stayed in a home during the Downton Abbey or Murdoch Mysteries era, and some modern conveniences were Jerry rigged within. The rooms literally felt like a time machine into the 1800s complete with the old style solid metal skeleton keys, and there were an odd appearance of modern items here and there. The hosts, a Chinese family, are very welcoming, friendly and strive to make the guests as comforting as possible. Their breakfast room is incredibly generous, with snacks and even entire meals (in a freezer available) available at all times with tons of beverages both hot and cold also available. Honestly, I like the place, and while I never used the jacuzzi in my room, they even made all the possible oils and refreshing lotions (and actually fairly high end stuff) available too. Most importantly,  this place is incredibly well situated, being literally minutes walking time from the Fisherman's Wharf, the Royal BC Museum, Chinatown, the government buildings and do on. It's also walking distance to a supermarket and a few convenience stores as well.


Gorgeous place and generous/thoughtful host!
7:00 to all day breakfast hour - Great hot breakfast and some Asian selections. Will visit again :))


Generally good but we had problems with our toilet in the Kingston suite. In general the bathroom wasn't particularly clean. UV disinfecting was a nice feature, but lights and electrical looked a bit dodgy. Great location however!


Great place to stay in Victoria. Very convenient to ferry and downtown, but on a quiet residential street. Tasty wholesome breakfast.


Beautiful house with a wonderful host! The breakfasts were incredible! This house is also walking distance to everything, and has free parking. I will definitely be back!

Compared to other tea rooms in the area, this one takes the tea cake! The atmosphere, staff, quality of food and the price are top-notch. For those coming in from a ferry or seaplane, it is a short walk from the terminals and well worth it. Forget the Empress, this place puts it to shame. Perfect for a day-trip stop, a friendly get-together, or a date. Get a reservation and ask when the busy-time is in hopes to avoid it. Having the opportunity to speak with staff and hear their recommendations is best.


The afternoon tea here is amazing! The front staff were very helpful and really nice too. The food is fantastic and they have a great selection of tea as well.

I do wish that they had an online booking for the restaurant, and when I contacted the email provided there for the restaurant I was given a curt response to reach out to the email below but there wasn’t one included in the email.  Thankfully we were able to come in in the morning and get a table for that afternoon so it all worked out! :)


I love afternoon tea and Pendray Inn and tea house was a great experience. I loved the house and the history of the place. The interior construction and design is so beautiful. The tea selection and service was excellent. The food was very good and the scones tasted so crunchy buttery and soft on the inside. I gave a 4 star rating for 2 reasons. Our table and the food. Our table was tiny and we were stuffed into a corner. I felt so crowded at the table and like we were placed there as an afterthought. The food for the most part was delicious but I felt like the 2 scones was a lot, I wanted more from the savories, and the desserts were pretty basic. There was a smoked salmon and capers pinwheel which was barely 2 small bites, I could have had another. The crab cake was tiny and so was the chicken salad puff. This was still a lovely experience and the food was very good. I would recommend it.


Wonderful afternoon tea in a historical building.  The scones are amazingly fluffy and a great selection of teas.  Service was impeccable and quality of food was excellent.

Only reason atmosphere was not 5/5 is because it can get noisy in there once it fills up.  Nothing else is wrong!


Visited this quaint yet beautiful teahouse close to the harbour. Had a wonderful high tea experience with my family. Not only did they have vegetarian options, they also give the option of vegan high tea! Their tea was great and tea time offerings were delicious. Service was impeccable and all staff were extremely polite. Highly recommended!

the kitchen is well stocked and has all the essentials for cooking if you need to.

we walked to thrifty foods and got some food for our 4 day stay. would absolutely recommend and stay again.


We visit Victoria at least a couple of times a year for about 25 years now. We have stayed in many places, but this was our first time at the Oswego. We loved our stay. Everything was spotless. The kitchen was a good size as well as the whole suite. We stayed in a one bedroom suite and it was perfect for us. Lots of room well appointed. Front desk staff were excellent also and the location is superb. We will definitely be back we loved our stay.


The only best thing out of our recent Victoria trip was Oswego. The employees were super friendly our room was clean! Had a nice smell coming in, fans on (hot sunny day it was) with music playing, a personalized welcome card with our family name and one for our dog. We were staying at the 2 bed boutique suite and the view was amazing ! Had a lot of slide doors leading to a huge patio. Kept the space very bright and breezy with fresh air flowing in and out. The only downside was that I think there was a wind storm.. it got really chilly so we couldn’t eat out on the patio table. Wish the beds were a bit bigger, at least Queen sized for a family of 4 to stay. But otherwise, definitely coming back !


Great location, just off the main harbour, short walk to everything. Large rooms with lots of features. Loved having a balcony. Staff were all very friendly. It was nice there was electric vehicle parking for free, charging rates were fair. Elevators were slow. Some items in the kitchen and desk were very dusty. Room was hot as there was no A/C, but it was exceptionally hot.


After searching many places to stay for our short one day/night in Victoria, I was very pleased with our choice. We wanted to check out the city in a few short hours and managed to get a lot in within walking distance of our hotel. We stayed in a studio suite, which is equivalent to a large regular hotel room with a huge bathroom and kitchenette. We asked for a playpen for our toddler, and was all set up with linens prior to our arrival. Easy check in/out as well as underground secured parking. Very happy with our choice!

Located amongst the beautiful heritage houses of James Bay, only a couple blocks from Beacon Hill Park, Dallas Road and the beach, a quick 12 minute walk to downtown Victoria and a 10 minute walk from all major bus routes.  There is off-street parking for 3 on a first come first serve basis and parking was never an issue.  The back yard, deck and garden were beautiful.  It's dog friendly and they didn't think twice about taking my 40 kg dog and I for a months stay.  Keo and Niko were extremely accommodating and anytime I needed anything, they responded almost immediately and provided it asap.  The suite is located in an old heritage house so expect the quirks and slight wear and tear of an older house but that is 100% part of it's charm.  My large fully furnished suite was way cheaper and quieter than a tiny hotel room, the bed was super comfortable and clean, check-in was extremely easy and communication was top notch prior to and during my stay.  Would not hesitate to stay there again!


Fantastic furnished suite in a historic house. Quiet neighborhood within walking distance of Everything you would need or want to see!  Staff is extremely responsive and friendly. Stay here if you want a hassle free visit in Victoria!


Quite a good place to stay. Appreciated a bunch of things like the claw foot tub, ice in the freezer, and spacious rooms. Kept seeing hair and dust balls in the bedroom. Bent down and looked under the bed. Clearly been too long since that area was properly cleaned. Had a general experience that the suite could have been cleaner (had to wipe the dust off the leather chairs before my friend and I could sit...). Not much of a sound barrier between suites 2 and 3 in the back if you're a light sleeper. Otherwise grateful to have discovered these accommodations.


- They changed the cost of the room,,,
- They tried to charge me for the transfer from the reservation point to the suite (8 minutes by car)
- Only speak English

The hotel is within walking distance to Victoria downtown. Our room was pretty quiet at night. The staff was very friendly and helpful and also assisted us in lifting our heavy suitcases up the staircase. The breakfast was super delicious as well.


My wife and I had a wonderful stay this weekend at Abigail's Hotel. The location is very central and convenient. The rooms are comfortable, clean, and have everything you need. I appreciated the thought that went into every detail - from the location of the wall plugs, to the free snacks. The employees were very personable and kind. The real highlight, however, is the breakfast. It is like no hotel breakfast I have ever had - and better than most restaurants! There are gourmet options like eggs Benedict and Belgian waffles. Could not recommend this hotel enough.


Our first visit to Abigail’s Hotel was a delightful experience. All staff were friendly and professional and our room in the Carriage House was spotless with everything in its place. The handwritten personalized welcome card (and cookies) were a nice surprise, as was the relaxing background music that made our first moments in our room so comforting.
The included breakfast each morning was a special treat - thanks chef :)
The library/lounge, adjacent to the lobby, was cozy with comfy chairs and also a table should you want to play cards or a board game.
An easy 10 minute walk gets you to the inner harbour with all the popular shops and attractions.
We’ve travelled globally, and can honestly say Abigail’s Hotel ranks in our top ten!
We’ll definitely be back!! ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️


Absolutely lovely hotel. The staff are A+ and wonderful.

It's an old converted mansion which gives it this lovely homey feeling.

My visit started when I was still in my car. The man at the desk came out to greet me and helped me park. My room was in the coach house.

When I walked in there was cookies on the bed, gentle piano music playing on the radio, and the room was ever so slightly scented from a wall plug.

Super comfy bed. I slept really well.

The rain head shower and the jetted soaker tub were also a treat.

Breakfast was included, and I got a private table in the library to eat at and enjoy my coffee.


I wish I could live here. I loved every moment of our stay. The friendly staff welcomed us into the stunning hotel making us feel right at home. From the gorgeously appointed rooms to the scrumptious breakfast in the dining room we felt at home and welcomed. We stayed in the Tiffany Rose room on the fourth floor. Trudging up the stairs (being in one of the older buildings there is no elevator for some of the rooms) we were rewarded with a beautiful room including a warming fireplace and a large soaking claw foot tub that we were sure to take advantage of. I can’t say enough good things about Abagail’s Hotel and we will be back as soon as we can.

I truly hope you reopen soon!! Wonderful memories we had and we stayed in the Juliet room!! Come back!!!!


The staff was very friendly - so hospitable!!!  Nice little lounge where we played Scrabble (provided by the inn).  Room was clean and we had a beautiful private rooftop deck.  The only room for improvement in my opinion is a new mattress and pillows would make sleeping more comfortable.  Excellent stay!


If you can imagine a page out of an old English fairy tale, this is it. If you love old world charm, you will love this place. It's true to its roots... don't expect super modern amenities (for its charm it has plenty of amenities, however!), but expect tons of old world charm. The room was clean, and comfortable. The picturesque building is a marvel to look at! And, close to lots of food, and only minutes from the water.


Very nice building on the outside in a good location. Our room however could use some renovation. It looks all a bit dated and the room organization is less than optimal. Furthermore, the door can't be bolted from the inside and the refrigerator was broken. The included breakfast was okay, but nothing special.


This hotel has the potential to be great but right now its not - so much so that I don't think the rooms at the top of the hotel should be rented at all.
The floor slopes badly so you are continually fighting to stay in the bed, there is no insulation so the room is unbearably hot and no air conditioning other than a standard fan and open windows.
The bathroom door didn't shut properly, there was a big crack across the hand basin, and the light in the bathroom was inadequate. There was also mold around the shower / bath.
To get to these rooms you need to lug your cases up 4 flights of stairs (the last two being very narrow) as there is no lift.
The emergency exit stairs appear rotten and you feel as if you used them you could become the emergency.
Breakfast is complimentary and there is an acceptable range of food except you wonder about the hygiene practices of the staff when they put out tongs for the guests to use but then put the croissants on the tray with their bare hands.
All in all not somewhere we could recommend unless significant repairs and renovations are made.

Our tour guide, Danielle, was friendly while being very informative and helpful.

An impressive landmark, with rich heritage... truly beautiful building.  Amenities were nice, and the location is amazing.

Non members can book rooms here, might be a unique place to stay on your next visit to Victoria.


The Union Club is a century old plus property steeped in British history and tradition.  It is actually a private club that offers hotel accommodations.  Dare I say, it is something an old boys club with archaic dress codes, and on some evenings men only in the lounge. It does have some great character, history and architecture on the main level, however the room we stayed was disappointing.    To put it bluntly the property looks a bit tired, and we were surprised that some basic amenities were absent the room.  I’ve stayed in other century old properties, however they’ve managed to modernize without losing charm and character.

The pictures on their website made our room seem larger than it was, ours was very small with no a/c and an awful bathroom.  The bathroom had no exhaust fan to vent shower steam requiring guests to open the old windows a crack, not too much as you would provide other guests a show.   Paint was peeling in spots on the bathroom walls likely due to moisture and some patches were painted with a noticeable difference in colour.   The soaps and shampoos provided were motel quality, and the shower stall annoyingly didn’t have a simple shelf to place soap and shampoos, which required opening and closing the shower door to retrieve them while showering.  This may sound like nit picking however it results in a wet and slippery bathroom floor. The mattress seemed old as it offered little support as one sinks into it, unless super soft is to your liking.

There is no on-site parking which requires guests park their car a couple of blocks away in a parkade, fortunately everything is within walking distance so there is little need to access your car unless leaving the downtown core.  On the bright side the breakfast offered in the downstairs dining room  was excellent as was the service.  We did not have dinner as we decided to dine at nearby restaurants, all within a few minutes walk of the Inn. There is no room service offered, however they will allow you to come downstairs to grab a meal and bring it back to your room. They do have a quaint rooftop terrace where you can view the harbour and enjoy the ocean breeze with a drink and company.  Maybe the larger rooms with sitting area are better, unfortunately none were available for our booking.  I will add it is a quiet night stay.

It is certainly a property connected to the history of Victoria, and I’m sure if the walls could talk it would have some wonderful stories to tell.  If you want a property filled with history,  some great artwork on its walls, and you are willing to forgo some convenience of a more updated property, then you will likely enjoy it.


Joined the club in March.
Nice quiet peaceful atmosphere.
Have eaten some awesome dinners. Five star meals and service.


Went to meet a friend in Victoria this night. What a disappointment. Rude, uncommunicative staff...below average food. I witnessed the bartender emptying a bag of potato chips into a bowl and serving it to a table. This Union Club in Victoria is dead. Old money and stock market spinners. Don't waste your time unless you need to sell yourself.


I hadn't been in years, but went for dinner tonight to celebrate a friend's birthday. The building is absolutely lovely. The staff were helpful and welcoming from door to table. The dining room service was absolutely excellent. The dinner was delicious. The food was better than I remember. I had the Ceasar salad and for an entree, the salmon, both excellent. The bathrooms are clean and well provisioned. The place is steeped in the elegant history of a bygone era and worth a visit just to stare up at the carved wood paneling and gorgeous vintage glass.

Careen was a great hostess who gave us a very nice breakfast te next morning... after the BEST sleep ever! There was so much to see and do.  Thanks Careen!


This was a great b&b experience! We stayed for two nights and found the room comfortable and clean.

The location is great, there are tons of restaurants on Fisherman's Wharf, a water taxi stop, and whale watching tours. It's a bit of a trek to downtown from here but the taxi rides were cheap, and when it wasn't raining we walked and really enjoyed the views along the way.

I would definitely stay here again!


Careen was awesome! She is very accommodating with check in and check outs. Luggage drop off and easy check in. The place couldn't be more convenient.  Close to everything or just jump into a water taxi to get to downtown. Bed was so comfortable and quite place to sleep. Price was reasonable.  Aloha and Mahalo


We travel to Victoria several times a year and recently decided to treat ourselves to a stay at the Fisherman's Wharf Bed and Breakfast.  We had seen the B&B before and thought it looked cute and now that we have stayed there we can confirm it is cute inside as well!   We stayed in the Poppy room (1 of 2 rentable rooms), and it had delightful elegant poppy décor.  The room was more spacious than we anticipated, the bed was comfortable, everything was clean and well cared for and we felt very welcomed when we arrived.   We were surprised to find that the B&B isn't noisy in the daytime or at night and having our own little balcony over the water was a treat.  There are lots of windows so it is bright inside.  There was some gentle movement from the water (there was a breeze but not a strong wind) but it didn't bother us at all.  We were given a coupon for breakfast at the Imagine Café which serves organic food and offers ' an experiential & transformative learning space designed as an internship business program for young adults, all cultures & all abilities.', which we thought was wonderful.  We both had their French Toast with whipped cream (hey we're on vacation!), which was delicious but we were so tempted by their pastries we bought scones for breakfast the next day.  We really love the way these two business mutually partnered to support each other's local business in such a positive way and it was a real win win for us the guests.  Parking was included in the cost and was easy to find and close by.  Overall it was a great place to stay and we have already posted about it and told many friends because it was a much more enjoyable place to stay than a standard hotel!


Stayed here for one night during a vacation out to BC. Wish we had booked many more nights to stay here after the first. The location was amazing, with a water taxi located right outside the door, many places to eat on the wharf, and a whale watching tour (discounted for tenants at the BnB) taking off from the same dock. In one day we had amazing fish&chips, saw whales and took a water taxi for a delicious dinner downtown victoria.

Despite the house being on water, it did not move much, only subtle rocking which wasn't even perceivable to us as most times.

The owner was German - like me, and she gave us tons of good tips where to go to have a great time. The rooms were clean, the breakfast was solid.


This B&B is located in a very quiet area, minutes away from downtown Victoria. Richards is a great host, that takes care of you like your were family.

The rooms are spacious and very clean, but could use a little bit of an upgrade in the recent future (e.g. our bed is a bit squeaky and the mattress quite hard).

Breakfast is great and we got a fresh made omelette, as well as fruits, croissants, cereal, fresh coffee, and more.


They Cheat and charge extra money!!

We booked a 2 Queen beds in a apartment that clearly stated 4 adult occupancy. After the booking, within few minutes the owner called and said the room rate is only for 2 adults and she will charge me 120$ extra for the additional two adults, which is outrageous!!

She was Rude and Sarcastic when I mentioned the travel website clearly shows occupancy of 4. I cancelled the Hotel right away within 10 minutes of booking and still she charged me the penalty. She will pay her karma

please STAY FAR AWAY from this hotel.


Unfortunately we only stayed one night in this beautiful B&B. We had the ""Serengeti"" and the ""Hemingway"" suite. Both were very lovely and cozy. Charly and Patti are very friendly and have a lot of tips for places to visit. If we come back to Victoria we will definitely book this B&B again!


We had a great stay the host are extremely sweet and the room was very clean. It is outside the Victoria hussle so, it was quite. The breakfast was huge and they catered to food allergies.

Clean but simple. Great downtown location. Front desk lady Jocelyn made us feel welcome and was very helpful. She was our favorite front desk lady. I would stay again for sure.
Do wish the hotel guests didn't have to walk around to the front entrance of the pub


We stayed at this delightful hotel over a 4 day weekend. The staff were all helpful and friendly - from the bar to the front desk to the folks who cleaned our room. The bar was fun with great Happy Hour offerings. The room was large and very clean and we had a lovely view of the harbour from our Juliette Balcony. A great place in a fun part of Victoria!


This is a very late review from about 2016. We stayed here for Christmas weekend and got I think one of the 2 bedroom suites. First off the service here is very friendly and efficient. You get free coupons for drinks from the bar connected to it. The rooms/suites are nice,cozy and homey. Has everything you need. The location is pretty much in the heart of Victoria so everything is easy access. I can't remember how the parking situation was. The pricing is also very fair. My family and I loved our stay here and will definitely stay here again. It's not your typical hotel, it's more boutique and unique.


The hotel is cool in that it has quite a bit of history but the room had a noticeable smell that is common in older buildings. Opening the windows helped. Great location, easy access to lots of great places in the area.


The location is wonderful and we had a one bedroom suite which was very large. It was comfortable temperature wise and the bed was comfortable as well. I enjoyed how convenient to some great food options. Only minuses were the shower and and that the Chromecast didn't work in the living room.

The staff is so, so friendly and made us feel right at home. The common room is super comfortable and also nicely decorated. Another venue we would liked to stay longer. The location is very convenient, within walking distance to Victoria downtown and very quiet at night.


Very nice experience at Marketa's B&B in the honeymoon bedroom! The location is great (downtown 5 min walk from the legislative assembly), the rooms are spacious, the decoration is well chosen, the breakfast is delicious and homemade, and the bed is comfortable. You will feel home. I definitely recommend.


Located near parliament building. Quick access to fisherman’s wharf, downtown and all the go to places. Staff is pretty friendly and hospitable. Rooms are beautifully decorated, although beds could be a little un-comfortable. Breakfast is lovely.


Marketa's B&B is charming with character, located in the quiet and lovely James Bay area. The rooms are clean and beds so comfortable! And the breakfast which is included with each stay is sooo delicious! Marketa as well as her staff serving the breakfast in the mornings are all very hospitable! I will be back for sure!


It was a great cozy place, just a few steps away from Victoria downtown and many places of interest. Staff was super friendly. The breakfast was included, and it was delicious. Enjoyed our stay very much

I stayed in August of 2017 for 5 days with my 2 children and had a wonderful vacation.  The house was cozy and very clean in a really safe, quiet neighborhood. It had everything from towels to soap to dishes as promised. Denise and Robert were very kind hosts and had prepared all sorts of extra things such as up to date maps and brochures. They had great suggestions of where to visit as well. The house was located within walking distance of downtown, parks, a grocery store, laundromat and coffee shops. It truly was a home away from home.  We will definitely consider this place whenever visit Victoria.


This was a great vacation suite for two people, very centrally located to downtown and the Inner Harbour! It is located on a quiet street in James Bay, very safe neighborhood. Robert and Denise met us when we arrived, showed us around and provided instructions for everything. There is also
lots of information about restaurants, shopping and things to do in the suite.

The kitchen was well stocked with all the basics and more. It was nice to relax in the morning and be able to make our own breakfast.

The bathroom though small was functional and our hosts not only provided the usual toilet paper but soap, shampoo and conditioner as well. I suggest bringing a hanging toiletry bag to help with limited counter space.

The queen bed was very comfortable.
Though Victoria was having a hot spell we found the unit to be easily
cooled by opening the windows for a cross breeze and using the fan our hosts provided. I particularly liked the labeling on many items as an explanation for their use.
There was a parking spot in front of the suite which was very much
a plus.
For those who are interested the high speed Internet worked well.
We spent a week at HarbourWalk Suite and would love to return.


A wonderful find!  It is a quaint looking1922 cottage with a clematis clad veranda which can be used for relaxing while appreciating the charming homes across the way and the horse drawn carriages touring this historic street.  The area is quiet despite being so close to major roads.

We liked staying here much better than a hotel as we had a full kitchen giving us the option of preparing some of our own meals. Denise and Robert showed attention to the details by providing everything needed including paper towels, tissues, towels, sharp knives, coffee filters, good quality appliances and dishes, a large comfy bed, umbrellas and brochures about attractions and restaurants in Victoria. The unit was very functional and clean!  Perfect for two people.   It is situated within easy walking distance of a  grocery store, coffee shops, restaurants,  a laundromat, and many of Victoria's major attractions.  A small word of warning, you need to be agile to climb into the lovely clawfoot tub/ shower.

Robert and Denise were quick to respond to our email inquires and their quoted prices include all taxes and fees!  Our stay there was June 16-21, 2017.  We highly recommend this unit and plan to return.

Such a wonderful charming place to stay in Victoria!! This place is a gem and is centrally located making it easy to walk to the many wonderful sites! Staying here puts you close to the walking paths along the water, to Fisherman's Wharf, the Inner Harbour and downtown! There is also a grocery store, pub and coffee shop within a couple blocks.
The suite has everything you need and is super clean. I highly recommend staying here! I hope to be back there myself.


The Harbourview vacation suite is perfectly located on a lovely, quiet street close to downtown and the ocean. I stayed there by myself and felt very safe. I was able to walk to grocery stores and to coffee shops. I travel a great deal and stay in various vacation rentals and this suite was the cleanest vacation rental I have ever stayed in. So nice!  Thank you Denise and Robert for the stay!

Outstanding location and always good food. They prepare a lot foods themselves like the smoke albacore tuna which is excellent. Many of their beers are very good and the ginger ale they make themselves is the best I've ever had and I've had a lot, try it. If you like ginger you'll be blown away. In a busy place service is a challenge, so best if you're not wanting to eat and flee. We found they try hard and are all really nice to deal with. We like them!


Not only is the view amazing but this place is well run. We had excellent service from our waitress even tho she was busy. We ordered grilled cheese sandwiches with truffles fries. My fried added pulled pork ($3 add on) in her gets and I added tomato ($2) and carmelized onion ($2) in mine. I don’t normally say this but this was the best grilled cheese I’ve had anywhere. Fries were crispy, warm and seasoned just right.

We shared a piece of carrot cake and it was fabulous. I don’t like icing and this one only had icing between layers of moist cake. They finished it off with Carmelo sauce and spiced, candied nuts that are made in-house.

We also ordered some non-alcoholic cocktails and it was so good - we got seconds.

This was a fantastic evening and our bill came out to a very reasonable cost. Already planning to go back for their chowder.


A local favourite that never disappoints! I come here often and am always impressed by the food and service. Recently, my server Mackenzie was so attentive and friendly. It’s such a comfortable atmosphere with a great view. Amazing breakfast sandwiches, with house made bread and smoked salmon. First time in for breakfast and I’ll definitely be back!


I normally come here for dinners or happy hour as this place has a great atmosphere and pool tables to enjoy with friends. I went here for brunch alone and I enjoyed my view and the food I ate. However, the service was not up to its usual standard for me. I had a server who started off by grabbing me tea and helping me order my food which was great! But after the tea arrived, she did not check in ask if I needed anything else or how the food was once I received it. I saw her check in with other tables but she did not stop by my table at all. I had to ask another server if I could order another drink. I am disappointed with my experience despite normally loving it when I come here. Hopefully it was just an off day for the server but for now I’ll most likely just stick to coming in the evenings.


Took my high school friend here and she loved it! We sat downstairs. Upstairs the pub atmosphere is a little loud for dinner imo. Great pizza and fish and chips. Had the hazy IPA and double IPA. Fantastic! Most of all, our server Steve carried the day!! Super attentive and polite, his upbeat manner and extensive product knowledge was very much appreciated!! I’ve been coming to Spinnakers since 1990 and it NEVER disappoints.

The reason we picked this Hotel was because of the location and the fact it was pet friendly. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to accommodate my requirement for an early check in. The room was obviously one of the newly renovated ones and was clean with decent amenities.
Unfortunately the furniture had seen better days with chips and dings. One of the dressers had 2 legs on one side and was definitely left leaning . Despite the bathroom being recently renovated the tape between the ceiling and the wall was coming free  and there was glue on the floor from the laminate being installed. Also one of the screws missing from the beauty ring on the shower tap which is going to lead to water ingress and mould. The heat in the room had 2 modes hotter than hell or off. The PTAC air conditioner functioned but being winter we didn't bother using it.
The rooms are clean and functional with good amenities and a large screen TV. It was also extremely quite given that it was a Friday night. So If  you're looking for a lower priced decent alternative when travelling give this place a shot.


When I first booked and went on a site, it showed free breakfast. I searched again, got a different website, and it showed no free breakfast, just Crow’s restaurant available. This bothered me a bit. I flip the comforter and it has a spill mark on it which means it was not washed. There’s black mildew all over the windows which was a little disturbing. We went to use the business centre and there was no power cord to printer. Thankfully the front desk lady let us send it to her email to print. The beds were comfortable which was great though. I think this hotel could do better with attention to detail. Very friendly staff though. Always smiling.


A little pricey for the quality of the hotel, but it was not a bad spot for the night.  The crow crow restaurant was quite good.  The hotel is under Reno's, so we would stay again. Hopefully some of the issues, mostly cosmetic, will be addressed the next time.  The room was clean, but the duvet had a big burn hole in it. Staff was helpful and friendly.


Hotel was great. The staff was so friendly and helpful. Room was clean and tidy. We rented the 2 queen bed suite and the room was as big as a one bedroom apartment which was a nice surprise. The room itself was only $100 which was a steal of a price. They have laundry facilities and a great restaurant also. Would recommend

This heavenly little place and the angels that work here helped to get us through a very difficult time.


The house was immaculately clean including the cozy front room and kitchen. Covid protocols were followed very well. A tour made us comfortable in the home and allowed us to have food in and served with dishes from our dedicated cupboard. We enjoyed walking around the quaint neighborhood.


Amazing staff and a lovely home. So grateful we had somewhere to stay so close to the hospital! The walk to the hospital is only 10 minutes, which makes frequent shorter visits quite doable. It was also really nice to be able to use the kitchen. I felt very comfortable staying here. Thank you, Heart House!


Such a wonderful place to stay.  The staff are so helpful and caring.  They make the best breakfast to start your day.  The place is so clean and nice.  One of the best things is to meet with other people and share our stories.  I could only stay 2 days, since they were booked, but those 2 days really helped me cope.

The staff (Michelle and Leanne) are great, always friendly, and helpful.  The suite is large and airy. Lots of room for us and 3 kids.
I really appreciate the in suite washer and dryer, I suggest using it during the day as they are in the loft closet and a bit noisy.
The location is close to Chinatown and several other touristy places. So you don't always need to use your vehicle.  We took a water taxi over to the Empress and then walked to the BC museum and Parliament building.
You can find parking in the area, but it was easier to just use the valet parking at the Best Western.
There is a bbq on the rooftop and a lovely deck up there when the weather is nice.
I'm sure we will be returning each year.


Rooms are nice and spacious , the only downside is when travelling with little ones (that are loud). Even though there aren't many suites, it's a little worrisome when they're noisey or hyper!

Walls are somewhat thin, and you can hear everything,  especially if you're on a lower level and someone above is moving a chair or furniture around.

But Loft suites are always fun!!

Staff and super friendly and very quick on their feet! Always smiling and makes the entry way extra welcoming.

Lots of little shops and restaurants around,  highly recommend Indian Aroma if you're into that cuisine!!! *drools*


This is a timeshare location not a hotel. It was clean, centrally located and the condo itself exceeded expectations. Very fancy! The other reviews said it didn’t have ac but ours did so they must have added that. The rooftop was great view at night. The kitchen comes stocked with more pots and pans than I own at home! Although, we never ended up using it - there are a bunch of restaurants and cafes nearby. We came by ferry from WA and rode bikes to Sidney and back for the day, explored around the city of Victoria the other days. I would come back again, had a great time. Staff has limited hours so best for those that are self sufficient. We never needed help during our stay so worked well for us.


Central location, spacious rooms, and a full sized kitchen. Loved the space and how it was a loft. I liked the brick detail on the wall, large windows, and fireplace. Also appreciated the tv downstairs and upstairs. The bathroom lighting was also nice. There's only a shower, but it's large. There was  plenty of closet space downstairs and in the upstairs loft. Washer and dryer was also in the room. There was also a skylight. There were much more features than we used, but it was nice to have and could be good for a future visit. Overall, a great place to stay and staff were friendly!


Very nice accommodation and great location for walking around.  Small concern is night noise but it is a city after all.  Also a lot of homeless in the city but not a concern near the suites.

We were pleasantly surprised by our experience here. A simple motel that was very clean, with friendly staff, and rooms bigger than expected. Overall, we liked it a lot. The only downside would be the lack of air conditioning - we stayed in June and it was still warm in our room. If it had been any hotter, we would have looked somewhere else.


Very easy to access from transit and only 8 min bus ride from downtown Victoria. Reception staff was super friendly and helpful giving us a map and sightseeing suggestions. The room was more spacious than expected with a small kitchen table, microwave, fridge, sofa, TV, 2 closets, mirrors, washroom and 2 queen beds. Ideal for multiple people and longer stays.


The may be the cleanest motel I have ever stayed at.  The staff are friendly and accommodating.

Excellent value for the rate and located near many amenities.

I liked to walk downtown (20 min) but there are buses that pass by every few minutes as well if you are not driving.


We were very impressed with the size of the rooms. They were huge! And very clean with comfy bedding. For the price we paid, we consider this a hidden gem. It is near a Starbucks, Tim Hortons, several restaurants and a 7-11. You will be spoiled for choice, all within walking distance.

One small issue we encountered was that we could hear the people above us moving around in the morning, the floor creaked under their feet.

Great location, beautiful old heritage home in a surprisingly quiet neighborhood considering how close it is to downtown. You can easily walk to a lot of sights/attractions, including the ocean and Beacon Hill Park. Continental breakfast included fruit, yogurt and lots of lovely pastries, although I wouldn't have minded a greater selection of savory &/or protein choices and a communal dining area so we could meet up with other guests. There are always granola bars/candies/snacks, you can always brew yourself a coffee or tea, and the hosts are lovely - what's not to like? :-)


We stayed in the Sydney room of this gorgeous heritage house, which was lovely and bright with a delightfully comfortable bed and even had a bit of an ocean view. Shannon and the hosts were fantastic and went out of their way to get gluten free and dairy free breakfast options for the morning (which was so appreciated!).
The location is fantastic being one block from both Beacon Hill Park and my favourite rocky beaches along Dallas Rd, as well as a pleasant walk to downtown. I highly recommend this gem of a B&B and I am glad to know that we've found a home away from home for whenever we're next in Victoria. Pictured here is the sunroom view of the delicious breakie enjoyed by my partner.


Just back from a 4 day visit to Victoria, our favorite get-away city.  We
stayed at the Ashcroft House in the James Bay area, a departure form our normal hotel or condo in the downtown area.  We were very pleased with our decision.  Not only was the accommodation perfect for us (kitchenette and great bed in a heritage house with a great hostess Shannon) but the neighborhood was wonderful to walk in.  We enjoyed walks along the ocean front, Beacon Hill Park and the surrounding neighborhood with all the heritage homes.  We’re already planning a return visit next month.


This was our second time staying at Ashcroft House in the last 3 months. This time we stayed in the Jennings Burnett suite. It is so beautiful, sleeps 4. The Beacon Hill Park area is amazing, everything is in walking distance, beaches, downtown Victoria and I highly recommend a stroll through Beacon Hill Park to the shops along Cooke street.

The house is architecturally interesting and beautiful, and filled with antiques. The dining room has quite possibly the most beautiful stained glass windows that we have seen in a home. Our room was amazing, and furnished with antiques and art. Breakfast is multi-course and simply wonderful. It is served in the comfortable and antique-furnished dining room on English china and sterling silver (no silver plate here), and was delicious. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Joan is absolutely delightful - both service oriented and interesting to visit with. It is said that ""To be rude is very bad, but to be boring is unforgiveable!"" Joan is both polite, and fascinating to talk to. What a wonderful stay! Highly recommended.


I adore Joan!

I stayed here for two nights with my work team on a strategic retreat. It's a beautiful old colonial house in a gorgeous neighbourhood filled with lovely gardens, bees, deer, strolling people who smile and say hello, and within 7 minutes of downtown by car.

Joan's home is full of art, keepsakes, photographs, books, cds, bedrooms and bathrooms and a large garden with a couple of seating areas for reading, chatting and just relaxing.

Though my favourite place in the entire house is the kitchen - it's homey, and Joan is there :) She does most of the baking and cooking, and works hard to be as environmentally friendly as possible, which I appreciate very much.

The breakfasts are beautiful and generous. Lovely fruit plate, and one morning it was eggs cooked in bell peppers and baked with cheese on a potato patty with a tomato & salsa on the side, and the next was the biggest waffle with the best bacon I have ever had along with homemade rhubarb sauce.

There are no locks on the doors to the bedrooms, as someone mentioned, and it's not massive ensuite bathrooms people have become accustomed to in opulent hotels or chain suites... it's homey, interesting period rooms that attract people I feel safe and comfortable around, and Joan is always nearby.

Highly recommended! Tell her I sent you!


Fabulous happy and superbly fed weekend for me and my family.  Our son Ben took a photo of the breakfast table groaning with delicious food.  This should be on the index page of the web site.  It would attract hordes!

As a hobby web page maker, I suggest that the name of the business and web site be changed to ""Bed and breakfast with Joan Brown"" - or something like that.  This would move her up alphabetically on the listings.

Commendable, enjoyable, great food, great elegance, Joan is an excellent and charming host, great location.


Booked for 7 nights but on day 3 got told by the host we had to leave due to “tiredness” and “can’t be bothered with a B&B anymore” even though she was accepting new guests… very unprofessional and unpleasant host, wouldn’t recommend to my worse enemy!


I LOVE going to Joan Brown's B&B..Very relaxed atmosphere  beautiful house & grounds.  Joan is an awesome hostess & cook and has a welcoming personality!!

Unfortunately the breakfast in the sunroom is no longer served but muffins are baked in house every morning and comes with coffee and tea.

Hospitality was great and the staff helped us with all our needs. No air conditioning but the room temperature can still be pleasant by using the provided fans and opening all the windows.

Relatively comfy sofa bed too. Quite satisfied with this inn.


Fantastic little cottage style hotel, only a block and a half from the Empress and Parliament. You'll enjoy the charm of the old building, and the staff is friendly and mellow, which gives it a sleepy and relaxing tone, something I quite admired. I would recommend one change only, and this may have just been my bad luck, but it was my experience regardless: I would enforce a slightly more rigorous noise policy. There were two groups on the 3rd floor (across and beside) with teenagers or loud adults that took the noise to a very high level, albeit within hours. Because the hotel's charm is centered around it being quiet, restful and dainty in a sense, I would really try and protect that culture. The teenagers on the first night, 3rd floor (Feb 17th from 4pm to about 9pm) were screaming from their deck to people walking the street, laughing loudly and telling people to ""get some"". It was not a good sight. Granted, after that night they either left or quieted down completely, and I suspect that the hotel staff may have kicked them out.

Anyway, 5 stars all around, but I would kindly suggest that you really guard the noise levels. We will be back, we loved it.


Friends, you are just wonderful, everything is fine.  I give it a 4 only because the windows were dirty.
It seems that these windows have not been washed for six months.  And maybe more guys, please keep an eye on it Clean the windows.  It's the same view.


Cute place to visit for your trip to Victoria. Really close to the parliament building and the fisherman wharf. Great locations to visit for food and local scenery.

Rooms were very clean and modern. Good enough for couples that don't need too much space.


This is our favourite place to stay in Victoria. Tucked a block south of the Legislative Buildings in quiet James Bay. The ambience is like stepping back to the quiet of old Victoria.

The service is always incredible. The staff are wonderful at accommodating needs.

Miss the breakfasts, though. Waiting for a little thing called a pandemic to be over to bring them back.

We had a great stay at Trutch Manor in the parlor suite. This is a large suite with a comfortable bed. There were lots of antiques matching the theme. My choice of breakfast was the Belgian waffle and it came with a generous portion of fruit. We would definitely visit again


The rooms are very well laid out, spacious with lots of windows.  The bed is comfortable, the living room and kitchen functional.  A lot of the interior is cheap, simple carpets, cupboards, bathroom, appliances ect.  The building itself is classic and beautiful.  Pet friendly.  We enjoyed our stay and felt it was very worth the price.
Super nice neighborhood as well.


While I have actually never been inside Trutch Manor, posting this makes me want to ask for a viewing!
The grounds are impeccably kept and in the month of April the  the cherry trees are a Marvel to see for everybody who lives along this street where I visit my best friend regularly who lives right next doors!


We booked on Hotwire months before our July 2016 arrival.  We had called the Manor numerous times to confirm our arrival and booking.  We physically showed up to check in and there were other guests waiting outside on the front porch, frustrated that no one was present to check them in.  The female attendant arrived 10 min later to check in guests ahead of us.

She told us that they don't work with Hotwire and said we needed to call Hotwire for a refund, then she would charge us her fee for B and B, even though we had our Hotwire receipt showing everything was already paid.  The Manor might be great for some, no chance of us ever returning.  It was well maintained outside, musty smell inside.  We ended up at Days Inn Victoria and got a great deal on a great room last minute.

Close to downtown and the Seawall. I slept in one of the female dorms. There was about 4 of us in a room for 20, so it was very quiet in that way, but they're right across from a bar and it might be a bit noisy until 2ish. Showers are nice and hot. Everything seemed to be in good repair. Fitted sheets on the beds and towels that are not just white indicates they don't have a linen service or anything. Friendly staff. They'll let you leave your bag there during the day for free while you explore the city. I would come back again


I found my stay at HI Victoria to be great.  The staff were friendly and helpful and the whole place was quite clean.  Yeah, it's right on Yates and across the street from Lucky, so there's a good amount of noise at night but that's what earplugs are for.  The breakfast was typical hostel fare.  My bed was comfortable and the locker was a $5 deposit, of which $4 were returned on check-out.


Was kept awake by people yelling outside every night.    The dorms are very large with up to 20 beds.   The carpet in the dorm is badly stained and I would rather have Linoleum in a dorm, so the floors could be mopped.    The kitchen compost was really piling up and it appeared it was only emptied once per week, since there were five, five gallon pails.    This is unsanitary as the compost was decomposing.   Kitchen area is very poorly designed.   It would be nice to have some new matching dishes as they are inexpensive to replace.  Staff  were helpful and friendly.     The pool table upstairs could be heard from downstairs eating area.   People were respectful.    Lights next to the beds would be helpful so you could have some light without lighting up the whole dorm.  My locker was in need of some paint on the inside as it was rather dirty.


The staff individually are friendly and helpful. Victoria accommodations lean heavily on policies; this means they can not clean the washrooms but raise your cost of accommodations with ease.  This Hostel is definitely a young persons game. The furniture in the common areas is dated and not too comfortable- but if you continuously readjust you will be okay. The dining area is commonly used as a pseudo computer lounge. The kitchen is tight but it works. They do have safe storage. They do not have a courtesy phone- they have an old-school payphone that rarely accepts your quarters. There are two popular night club spots across the street. so that is loud. Yes it is close to town; but it's not the only place close to the city. If you need cheap accommodations- for short term and you are 35 and under- do it up.


good place, and great price for the location. The dorms were clean and the staff helpful.
We booked for two nights from Friday to Sunday and when we got back from our day on Saturday, we learned that our all of our stuff had been put in garbage bags because they put us in the wrong room the first night... I think they should've called us and they shouldn't have touch our things (placed on our beds and locker) without our permission... it was super weird and nothing like that had ever happened to me while traveling. The second room was okay.

My husband and I stayed at Fisher House on October 4 and October 5, 2019.  It was a fabulous experience. We were met, on arrival, by our delightful Innkeeper, Jennifer who was a wonderful host. The Inn was very Victorian, beautiful and the breakfasts were outstanding. Our bedroom and bed were luxurious. We did have a private bath, but it was across the hall. A little unique, but not a problem! I’d love to come again!


Beautiful house and location to tour around Victoria. Jenn made wonderful meals in the morning to set is up properly for our day. Beds were comfy and very clean. I will be coming back for sure with my next trip to Victoria.

On the harbor view side you can see the ferry, watch planes land and take off from the water, and see a draw bridge in action in the distance. Its only a 15 or 20 minute walk along the water to get downtown to see the sights so driving isn't necessary for many things. The property itself is well-maintained and the staff are attentive and helpful. Right across the street is a great Italian restaurant also worth visiting.


I stayed for a week in a two bedroom suite overlooking fisherman’s wharf.  The unit was really well kept with great features and a wonderful view.   The staff were excellent as well.  They really added to the experience and comfort by making people feel relaxed and at home.   I will definitely stay here again.


The room was great, only it had very dark walls painted a darker color, so it was darker than was good for me.  I really  need lots of light for my well-being.  The View was superb!  Our room had everything we would need.  The kitchen had the extra things you might need, like a blender or kettle decent quality pots to cook with.  The room even had a washer and dryer.  It had two bathrooms too.  We enjoyed it very much!  Very close walking distance to the museum and parliament buildings.  It was a delight to stay here.  Thank you to the staff for helping make our stay so pleasant.   All photos  of the outside were taken through the window of the room.


Stayed mid December 2022. 2 bedroom suite was gorgeous. Very clean and well stocked. Great view of Harbour. Upstairs guest flooded bathroom and water poured into our bathroom. We had to move units, a few doors away, les desirable view. Which is a pain to pack up, etc. All else very 👍

Comfortable Victorian Victoria!

Liked · This was a delightful stay in a comfortable old house. Very quiet, and easy access to downtown and Government House. Well-appointed room and bathroom, very comfortable bed and seating areas. The lounge was large and comfortable as well. Henry served up two spectacular breakfasts - notably different each day. You're away from the noise and hustle of the downtown area, and a wonderful neighbourhood to explore on foot, gawking at the gorgeous homes.


My wife and I recently got a chance to stay at Abbeymoore Manor and its quiet location was the perfect place to relax.  The property is set in a quiet neighborhood with relatively easy walking access to downtown (about 1 mile), a shopping center with a grocery, access to a beachfront and Craigdarrogh Castle.  The staff were extremely helpful, especially the owner Jeff who was will to lend us a car when a small emergency came up.  We stayed in one of the garden suites on the bottom level which was really well appointed, and would have been great if we would have wanted to make our own meals.  The room also featured an amazing bathtub which was perfect for a good soak.  The only downside was that since the room was on the lowest level it tended to be humid, but the staff had thoughtfully left a fan to help circulate the air.  The breakfast were delicious and creative.  Each meal started with a sweet course (yogurt parfait, waffles) often garnished with seasonal berries followed by a savory main course (fried egg, chicken & mac & cheese; eggs benedict; fried egg on top of hash potatoes).  The Abbeymoore is cozy and comfortable with a great deal of charm.


Just stayed at Abbeymoore Manor in Victoria. We had a delightful stay. Not only are the garden be rooms charming, the staff was lovely. Jeff and his crew went above and beyond what they needed to to make our stay wonderful. I had many pleasant conversations with them. I broke my wrist while hiking and they took such good care of me when I returned from the hospital, bringing me blankets when they worried I might be cold. I will definitely be returning.

As somebody who doesn’t drive but still wanted to make the most of the island experience, this place is situated perfectly close to downtown Victoria while not being close enough to be loud or frustrating. Its about a 10-15 minute walk to get either Downtown or to the water, whichever suits you best.

As for the room itself, we were lucky enough to get to stay in the cottage which was absolutely lovely. There was coffee and tea provided for us as well as filtered water, clean dishes and kitchen appliances that were clean and in working condition. The suite was incredibly tidy, quiet and private and there are many options for beds within the room.

Due to COVID restrictions, we didn’t see too much of the owners while we were staying there but they did call to check up on us the night we settled in AND wished us well on our way out. They seem like lovely people who are genuinely committed to providing a good experience for their customers.

I would 110% recommend this spot if you’re looking for a place to stay in Victoria. I can’t imagine how it could have been any better :)


We stayed there during phase 2 of the provinces re-opening, so we didn't get a chance to have breakfast, but the hosts were extremely friendly and polite. The room was charming and comfortable, and the house is very well located in a quiet neighbourhood approximately 10 minutes from the city centre. It's also right across the street from a decebt pub frequented by locals. I would highly recommend staying at this bed and breakfast.


Great little B&B.  Naoko and Dan were very quick to reply and easy to communicate with.  They accommodated some requests we had to the best of their ability.  The location is probably the best you can have without forking over a lot of money in Victoria, a few blocks away from the legislature, and a 5 minute walk from the harbour.  Their house was clean, breakfast was good, check in was easy.  Everything was as advertised.  They interacted with us a few mornings over breakfast and others they let us be.  They're a really friendly couple who deserve your dollar.


Nice place. Few steps away from the local Starbucks. The people working there were really nice. The breakfast was great! Enjoyed my stay.

This was my first BNB experience and it was everything we could have dreamed of. My mom and I stayed here for two nights. We were both completely charmed and completely satisfied. Vanessa was the perfect host, and we couldn't have asked for more. The Gingerbread Cottage is full of character, quirks, charm, and stuffed with history, treats, and curiosities. I would recommend it for just the breakfast. The location is amazing as well. Quiet but close enough to downtown and Dallas Rd that my mother, who doesn't like walking, walked everywhere with me. The Gingerbread Cottage was a big part of the wonderful memories I have of my visit to Victoria with my mother. Please go stay with Vanessa! Thank you, Vanessa.


Absolutely loved our stay. Vanessa is amazing, her cooking is amazing, and she provides a warm relaxing atmosphere. We enjoyed our conversations with her and appreciated her input on places to go. The house is decorated well and maintains a fun old feel. This cottage is located well. We walked most places and only drove when we went North to the gardens, and the Haunted Mansion tour. Walking distance to shopping, dining, and fun. Vanessa recommended a place to get fried fish that was actually really good! We will come again on our next holiday. Great place, great value, and we would definitely recommend a stay.


Vanessa provides a cozy and welcoming place to stay.  Each room is filled with art and history.  Very tidy and functional rooms.  It felt like we were staying with a friend!  Home-made Everything, with a twist of passion and creativity, for breakfast.  Vanessa is one of the most wonderful gourmet chefs that I have ever had the pleasure of encountering.  I dream about the breakfast that she made for us!  Thank you so much, Vanessa & Sweet Helper Lady.  We very much enjoyed our stay, and definitely recommend The Gingerbread Cottage!

I can't say enough wonderful things about this Inn. The decor was like something out of a movie or magazine and the staff were so nice and attentive. We stayed in the Emily Carr room, which is highly recommended. We were served incredible breakfast both mornings we were there. This is our home away from home whilst in Victoria. 6/5 stars if I could!


This is such a nice place to spend a romantic weekend.  We stayed in the Emily Carr room, which has a jacuzzi tub and a wood burning fireplace in the same room.  It's decorated in deep rich colours and has books about/by Emily Carr to read as you relax on the chaise lounge.
The library downstairs is stocked with snacks, wine, and board games to encourage guests to hang out and socialise with each other if they like.  It's a really cool way to meet other couples who are on their own romantic adventure.


We loved this quaint little (family run?) place. Sincere people, nice rooms. We went on our anniversary and they asked if we wanted to be bumped us up to a larger suite room. Nice breakfast and variety for food. Love how close and convenient to downtown it was that we could walk.

The room was amazing with many fine touches and abundant in comfort. The Inn and the grounds are delightful and private, easy to park and is as refreshing as having a second home with no hassles of hotel parking. The breakfast was very high quality of freshly baked breads and pastries, fresh seasonal berries, poached eggs (cooked perfectly I might add) and smoked salmon, with options and they remembered our dietary requests amazingly well! What was even more special is the fine experience of genuine hospitality from Sylvia, Ross, Judy and their caring staff that went above and beyond. This is our new home away from home whenever we revisit Victoria.


My husband and I have been to Fairholme Manor five or six time over the last 17 years (between 4-7 nights) and we always and I mean always feel welcome when we arrive.  Sylvia and Ross are the best!!

My husband and I have stayed in every room/suite except the French Country Garden and each one is beautifully decorated and beds are comfortable.

The location is great. They are next to the Government House that has a beautiful garden. Close enough to the inner harbour that you can either walk in 30 minutes or drive.

And the breakfasts, OMG, they are delicious and different each day. I love sitting at a table visiting with Sylvia and Ross along with the other guests from all over the world. It’s a great way to start your day.

I have been too many bed and breakfasts and none compare to Fairholme Manor.  I am looking forward to going back in the next couple of weeks and this time with my daughter for her 40th birthday.

Don’t hesitate to stay here - you will not regret it.

Thank you Sylvia and Ross for welcoming us into your beautiful home!

As always Sylvia and Russ provide an inviting and delightful environment. Breakfast is exquisite. The scenery and surroundings are a gift from God. We will be back


We booked is BnB day-of on a Sunday morning after we decided to stay one extra day in Victoria. Sylvia was so sweet and accommodating. As soon as we walked in, the house smelt like vanilla and honey and cinnamon from the homemade granola she was making. Sylvia checked us in and brought us to our room. We had to leave really early the next morning so she prepared a breakfast tray of yogurt, said granola, and strawberries we could keep in the fridge in our room to have ready. After a busy weekend and morning of exploring the city and lots and lots of walking, we really wanted somewhere to relax and not do much. This ended up being the perfect place. Our room was on the round floor and we saw lots of deers around the grounds eating from the feeders placed around. Luxurious bathroom to take a long bubble bath in and some of the softest robes to wrap up in afterwards. I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone coming through Victoria. Sylvia seemed to be so excited and passionate about her home and sharing it with each and every guest to come through.


I  needed a room in Victoria and impulsively booked Fairholme, thinking it was an average B&B. Upon arrival it became clear that Fairholme Manor was something truly special and that I'd lucked out in a big way. Sylvia greeted me and showed me the room - the Grand Olympic Suite, no less - and while I tried to pick my jaw up from the floor she showed me the sun room, balcony, garden...all stunning. Beautifully furnished and decorated, full of light, sea view....From the bathroom window you can see the grounds of Government House next door! My friend who is an antiques dealer was seriously impressed by the decor and the lovely European antiques and art that make Fairholme a standout. It was like living in Craigdarroch Castle but better, because Sylvia also makes the most beautiful breakfast! Raspberry lavender loaf? Scones with clotted cream? Homemade bread? Plus fruit, yogurt, homemade granola....simply amazing. Sylvia and Ross are also friendly and knowledgeable hosts who are incredibly helpful and truly want you to have a fantastic visit in Victoria. I'm so grateful for their kind welcome and restaurant recommendations - Sylvia literally called the restaurant and snagged us a reservation. I was supremely comfortable and will be returning. I promised the deer I would be back...

In 1995 my husband and I stayed in the Cottage at Heathergate House and loved it.  I had the wonderful opportunity to stay there again recently with three family members.  It was as lovely as it was before!  The outside courtyard/garden is absolutely beautiful and is the perfect place to have a cup of coffee before heading out for a day of sightseeing.  The cottage itself is clean, spacious, comfortable, bright and well appointed.  The fridge and cupboards were well stocked with more food than the four of us could eat during our 5 day stay.  Heathergate House is conveniently located in James Bay, close to everything!  Ned and Ann are consummate hosts and made us feel very welcome.  I would recommend Heathergate House to anyone who wants to ensure a wonderful visit to Victoria, BC.


Had a wonderful stay here with my husband! Ned and his wife provided top class customer service! The cottage we stayed in was so quaint and had all the amenities needed. Enjoyed making eggs and pancakes with the provided breakfast! Would highly recommend this B&B! Would defiantly stay here again! Thanks for everything!


Wow! Don't stay at any hotel! This cottage is wonderful!!

Really cool rooms, awesome service, stocked fridge when you check in. Juice, muffins, eggs, much more all included.

Really enjoyed our time here!


Lovely!! Close to the pier. Walkable distance to downtown. Very clean, owner is on-site and very gracious. Outside seating in lovingly maintained garden. I recommend this place absolutely.

It was rather small but it had tons of character.  The owner went above and beyond for me and made sure there were flowers waiting for my wife when we arrived.  She also let us check in early and helped out in many ways.  The loft had every amenity you would need and the kitchenette with fridge and everything was very convenient.  The room was clean and incredibly well decorated.  We were able to park on the property but there was also tons of street parking available.  You are close enough to downtown to easily walk but far enough away to get out of the hustle and bustle.  There are a couple unique coffee shops within a block as well.  This didn't diminish our stay at all but I would warn you ahead of time that the stairs to the bed are pretty steep and there isn't much storage space for luggage, so you will be going up and down the stair a lot.  I would highly recommend staying here for a weekend getaway!  Thank you so much for the hospitality!


Gorgeous property in Victoria. The rooms are spacious and well decorated and the view of the gardens make you feel like you are in quiet little oasis. It’s located very close to everything downtown and is easily walkable to shopping, food and exploring. I’ll most definitely be back again! Thank you to the great hosts!


What a treat! Auberge is a delightful home away from home. You can tell the owners have put a lot of love and thought into every detail at this property, there is endless character and charm. The property is almost 2 km from the main town centre, but it’s worth the walk and we were happy to do so. Check-in was a breeze (we didn’t even have to engage with the owners, but they were around if we had any issues). Having access to a washing machine and dryer was also an added bonus. We stayed in the Magnolia suite and it was definitely on the warmer side (we were there in summer) and whilst this didn’t bother us too much, if you’re easily perturbed by feeling a little clammy, this may not be the place for you. For us though, we would definitely stay there again.


Great place to stay. We rented the Carriage House and it was gorgeous. Beautifully decorated and very comfortable. Within a twenty minute walk of the Inner Harbour and some delicious restaurants. Would definitely recommend.


This is a little hidden gem within Victoria , we stayed for 2 nights , excellent service , very  clean and perfectly organized , very cozy atmosphere , we stayed at the magnolia suite , very comfortable beds , very tasteful interior , kitchenette is very well equipped , everything is so well thought out and very well managed , I can recommend this place anytime , I’m sure we will be back !

Really bad with guests and not smiling at all. The woman is nice though.


It’s very good service under everyone budget and near to downtown


Totally fine if you keep your expectations reasonable for $30. Cleanliness-wise, there was some old take out food in our room, a couple of empty bottles, and hairs in the shower but we didn’t mind that much since we just needed a place to sleep. The two guys working there were very nice and friendly and the place had student residence/communal vibes. I was a little scared off by the rating but it was ok for a hostel.


The staff were very Accommodating to me , being a student, and they made me feel at home- very friendly and would go back there again.


Very affordable and great for the price. Fantastic location, even if it seems a little scary at first. Stayed here 6 nights near Christmas with my wife and we enjoyed it very much.
Appreciated:
- clean bathrooms, very good upstairs shower
- hostess Sue was helpful w sightseeing ideas; was understanding when we thought we lost our room key & offered a discount to replace it (didn't need to after all, found the key)
- near to Downtown & many restaurants
- chance to store leftovers & save groceries

If you're interested in saving money while visiting Victoria, I'd suggest Turtle Hostel. The simple and clean room and communal kitchen are a great value.

Great free breakfast, lots to choose from and if you wish gluten free it will be arranged.


Went with our rugby club and they were tolerant of our large group and us hanging out at the hotel before going out on Saturday, which a lot of hotels are not!
I'm not too picky with cheap hotels, not no major complaints. However... one of our groups  found a used condom under the edge of the bed, which was pretty nasty! The staff handled this professionally and they were upgraded to a suite. Breakfast was fine too, but no waffles, lol!


Rooms smell of mold, dusty and stained carpet, air conditioning is old, noisy and dusty. I was expecting a small fridge in the room but there is none, no microwave. Staff are a little aloft, it seems like they are scared of any complaints. Complimentary breakfast was good but no protein sources served nor any choices of fruits but old apples. I won't recommend this hotel to any family.


The rooms are clean and good for the price. The elevator seems really old and feels very unsafe. The breakfast was average, and overall my experience was good but nothing that impressed me.


Cheapest place in Victoria for a reason. Hotel is shutting down soon and maintenance is at an absolute minimum. Staff was very apologetic and nice. Wouldn't stay again. Hard lumpy bed. No AC. All furniture was broken.

It was clean and in good condition, and a good size (for a couple). Had a full fridge, stove, and microwave and counter space. One closet for coats & shoes, and a larger closet in the bedroom. Nice desk for writing/computing. Wireless service worked well for the laptop. Patio door accessible through the bedroom leads to plastic outdoor table & 2 chairs on shared paved patio area with shrubs. Wonderful location downtown near the parliament building, and it's great for coastal walks along the boardwalks and trails.


So obviously the owners are writing these reviews.  This place is aweful.  There is no breakfast provided. The only saving grace is that it was clean on arrival (not a hotel and not cleaned again whilst you are there). The rooms are very (very) small.  They have old tired furniture, the bathroom has not had any work done to it since the 1970's - unless painting the metal bath and tiles with gloss paint (which is now pealing off) is your idea of updating- there is no extractor fan so the entire 'suite' is full of condensation everytime you have a shower - there is a tiny window but this is at head height on the main walkway to all the other rooms so anyone can look in if the window is open. The  'kitchen' has about 2 feet of worktop and a single sink (again from the 1970's); there is a cooker but no extractor fan so everything smells like cooking all the time.  You have to shut the bedroom door or the bed and all your clothes will stink.  The walls between the 'suites' are so thin I can hear EVERY SINGLE WORD  said in the rooms either side of us. Although they are not suppose to the tenants smoke on the balconys and because the windows do not shut properly the smoke drifts into your room  The internet is painfully slow and at best intermittent - if you think you can use the internet to download or watch netflix you will be sorely disappointed. The heating is a joke there is a fan heater in the lounge with large clunky push buttons - this blows mildly warmer air into your room and there is a 1 foot wide electric bar heater in the bedroom - this we have to have on 24 hours a day and then heat the rest of the place up by turning on the oven. The noise of the other people trying to heat their rooms with these antiquated 'heating' units is so load you cannot sleep without ear plugs and even then you are still woken up when they turn on and off.  We are stuck as there are very few places that allow you to stay with pets as Victoria is very anti pets. Tonight there was a physical fight outside our room - banging against the walls - we felt very unsafe.  Do what ever you can to avoid this place we regret being stuck in this position.....


Very accommodating with early check in, all our bags fit in one closet, comfy beds and above and beyond normal continental breakfast. Usually these types of coastal hotels try to get by on just location alone, but Admiral I'm really went all the way in providing excellent customer service.


This was a sensible decision to stay at this hotel for 2 nights. Due to its superb location we could easily circumnavigate other nearby attractions for the day, then not feel rushed to find accommodations at the end of the day. Highly recommend.


Rooms were clean, bed was very comfortable. Would have preferred a firmer pillow. Breakfast is included, and was great. I would stay here again.

Just because I did what he said he and asked of us which was to leave the property he gave us some time and after that time the cab driver came and left and upon leaving he the security guard came out and decided he was going to be aggressively loud and obnoxious with me and I will never recommend this place or this security guard for safety in any situation. I gave this place is zero out of zero thank you


Sure, the beds are a little small, but the pillows are just fine! And it was SO CLEAN. Everyone was absolutely awesome, from front desk to room attendants. Restaurant is closed now due to lack of business, but they do offer free coffee and muffins in the morning. We have stayed at a few hotels this year, and this was by far my favorite, and the cleanest. Pool, exercise room, sauna too!(Travelodge on our last trip was the worst, so was the Sandman!)


The room was clean and air conditioned.  There was a coffee maker in the room and the complimentary muffin and yogurt were appreciated.  However, I have a couple of observations.  1) A damage deposit was automatically charged to my credit card with the comment that it would be refunded in 24 - 48 hours if there was not any damage to the room.  That was not indicated on their website or Trip Adviser.  What assurance do I have that hotel management would not 'claim' that there was damage to the room so that they would not have to credit back my deposit?  I do not appreciate the assumption of guilt on the part of the Howard Johnson organization.  2) It would have been nice if there were a stopper in the sink or if the bathtub stopper worked.  Also, for the amount I paid for the room, one would hope to have glass glasses and coffee cups, not plastic or paper!  Overall, a low passing grade.


First things first: The room was quite clean, the beds were comfortable, and the view from our room was pretty nice. The kitchen suite was why we chose the hotel and it was equipped well enough to allow us to cook our suppers there. The price was very fair.

Aside from that, the hotel and it's decor are quite dated. Our room had an incredibly strong smell of a deodorizing spray or air freshener. It seemed as though there are a large number of people whom live at this hotel (not a negative, just a comment).

The pool area is nice enough, though spartan. The pool is allegedly 9' deep in the deep end, but I am not sure it was even 8'. Good size overall and nice to be able to play around in and throw a ball around. There is no hot tub, however both the men's and women's change rooms have dry saunas. The workout area has a treadmill, exercise bike, elliptical machine, and a TV to watch while you exercise.


We arrived late, hungry and tired to discover the restaurant and bar were closed for renovation. As was the pool. Neither were mentioned upon booking the reservation days prior.
We stayed in an executive suite. It was fine. Clean except for the grungy carpets. Dated decor but this I could live with.
They seem to have some live-in tenants which on two of the nights had loud, aggressive, vulgar and lengthy arguments outside our room which kept us awake.
The water was cut off for 5 hours midway through my shower. Leaving me with sudsy hair.
We ended our stay early and moved to the holiday express which felt like the ritz in comparison.

A short distance from the ferry stop, this is one of the few parks where the pictures accurately reflect the beauty of the park. It was a wildlife adventure in front of the rig with geese, eagles, otters, seals and deer. We booked to have a view of Victoria and were not disappointed. The concrete pads are excellent, there was decent distance from your neighbor, it was clean/well-maintained and the facilities (clubhouse, laundry and toilets) were top notch. The access to the harbor trail was a real plus for us and the dogs and walked it daily. Sites 9-14 are pull in sites with the best harbor views but will need to get used to people just randomly walking onto your site daily. You are only 15 minutes from the middle of the tourist area and there is a grocery store less than a mile away. Yes there are planes (and helicopters) sporadically landing and taking off in the harbor but it is fun to watch. The one big concern I have (and expressed this with other parks visited) is the “pet fee.” $84 CAD and literally no pet waste stations, dog run or any other pet-related services provided for this fee. Stop gouging pet owners. Have paid pet fees at other parks but at least there was something for the pet. Connectivity: park WiFi 86.1 down/16.3 up with some breaks in service; Verizon 164.0 down/37.0 up; T-Mobile 57.1 down/28.2 up


Met my high expectations.  Very clean, nicely spaced, and great views.    We took the water taxi to Victoria and back to eat.    Here you are out of the hustle and bustle since it is at the end of the road but everything is accessible.


Beautiful RV resort, well located. Nice view of the ocean. Friendly staff and very welcoming and helpful. Clean showers, on site laundromat. Definitely highly recommend this place. Now if it can stop snowing.


Loved it!  Beautiful path right there (Songhees Walk), enjoyed the float planes coming and going and catching sight of the Otters.  Well kept Lodge (to enjoy TV lounge, views and mingling with fellow campers! Catch the Water ferry right there to enjoy other parts of Victoria’s waterfront!


Loved this place, remember though.... it is ""glamping"" and not camping :)
Sites are a good size with a nice grassy area and some have extra paved area for parking a vehicle.  Views are incredible and all offer very interesting views.  A bit pricey but location is superb, right along the Songhees walkway, easy walk right to downtown Victoria.  The only missing star is due to their very lovely Clubhouse not handicap friendly, there are three flights of stairs, please put in an elevator so everyone can enjoy.  We camped in a 34' motorhome and had a lovely Thanksgiving, can hardly wait to go back again.
