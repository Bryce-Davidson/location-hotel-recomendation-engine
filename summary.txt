The Vic, Ascend Hotel Collection is a fantastic hotel located just a few minutes away from downtown Victoria. The rooms are modern and chic, with comfortable beds and clean linens. The staff is friendly and attentive, providing excellent service to guests. Some rooms even have board games, Foosball, ping-pong, TV and couches for entertainment. However, some guests have reported issues with the breakfast quality and lack of clear instructions on how to dial reception or request an iron/ironing board in the room. Additionally, there were concerns about safety in the underground parking area at night. Overall, The Vic is a great choice for those looking for a comfortable stay in Victoria with easy access to downtown attractions.
