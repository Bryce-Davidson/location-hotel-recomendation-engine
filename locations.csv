Such a great place!!! This park is a local treasure!!! Wonderful landscaping with a nice path system bordered by gorgeous flowers and shrubs. The new building will be a fantastic addition to this and ib look forward to its opening!!!


July 23/2022. 23¬∞C. The Esquimalt Gorge Park goes back a long way with Japanese history with a small garden that will
captivate you because of it's design. When we were there numerous small craft were getting ready to push off to go exploring.


Neat little park with an educational centre, small Japanese garden, many paved paths & picnic table. It's right by the Gorge waters, which allows for some nice walks with a sunset.


You must walk here to visit and enjoy. No parking until done construction.. Beautiful japanese gardens, has more potential as its being upgraded and im sure once the new centre is done the gardens will be looked after..

It has a big open space. However, there are not many things to do. Especially, if you have a toddler.

One of my favourite parks around! It's got a fence on the road side so you don't have to worry so much about runaway toddlers, and the playground/sandpit is good for toddler aged kids. Lots of green space for running around, trees for shade and benches for resting.
The only 2 issues are if you have a potty trained child, there are no washrooms. And there's no parking specifically for the park, so Hillside mall is where I usually park if I'm going here.


A really excellent park for kids aged 1+. Every structure is appropriate for toddlers, pretty much. Nice sand area with climbing obstacles surrounding it, made from old tree rounds. Access off a no exit street, so it's very quiet (even with North Dairy right there)


I visited the park today and here are my thoughts:
Pro:
-The play structure has a good variety of things to play on, as well as some swings, tree stumps to climb along and a sand box with donated toys.  A big plus if you don't always remember to bring your own toys.
-It is mostly fenced off with a gate aside from the side on sleepy Clawthrope Ave.
Con:
-No parking close by.  We walked with a stroller, but another mom came in a car and could only find residential parking.  She ended up parking down at Hillside Mall.
-No bathroom nearby, which is important if you have a preschooler or younger children potty training.  The closest is Hillside Mall or Cedar Hill Rec Centre.
-Potentially noisy.  The park sits right next to North Dairy Rd, so over time the traffic could get annoying.


Love this park. It is ultra close to Hillside Mall. It has a water fountain, a sand box and toddler size games. I would recommend to any parent. The downside is parking spots. Sometimes is easier to park in Hillside and walk.

I really like this park because it offers a lot of space for dogs to run around as well as areas to walk around in behind the ball feild.


Great park for dogs to run, but not fully fenced.


I always take my dogs to this park. Lots of friendly dogs.


When I was younger, there was a tunnel and then a bridge at the playground. I really think it was worth that extra star. Otherwise a fun place to play if you don't mind sandy playgrounds. There is a bathroom and a water fountain, which is convenient, and the trail is fun to walk on

Nice park. Bright and spacious.


Great playground for all ages and a field to run around in, picnic tables, and  bench to rest.


It can get really muddy at times but otherwise a beautiful little neighbourhood park. There is quite a large kids playground and swings, and a small pond for kids to explore. The playground has a wood chip floor.

Dogs are allowed off leash except within 10 m (30 ft) of the playground. The only road it borders is quite quiet but no 30 km/h posting for being around the park, so pay due caution.

No shelter available to protect from sun or rain, unfortunately. Bring an umbrella or shelter as required.


We like this park. Though there are no bathrooms, I think one should be built there's certainly enough space for one.
The toddler area is great, but the older kids slide is unusable, it's strange. Don't know if it is a slide or climb device. Another suggestion would be replacing woodchips with the playground foam. With the needle usage going up, it's much riskier with woodchips, sand etc. At least with the foam stuff, you can see clearly.
I love the little book library on the side too. We love putting books in, and also taking some.

A tiny little park with about 6 to 8 parking spots with access to the beach and the Songhees Walkway.

Marvin (my pup) and I strongly recommend checking out this peaceful gem!


Visited day and night time. Both amazing view. A little bit scary at night  if you are alone. Guaranteed to be back when it's not too cloudy!

I spent a year living close by. Every morning at dawn I would run along the breakwater from Ogden Point to Clover Point and count birds along the way.

One of them was smaller than I had expected.


Really nice park overlooking the water and if you‚Äôre lucky you‚Äôll see wildlife like otters. There are walking lanes and bike lanes and dog bowls for drinking water and benches and Adirondack chairs to relax in. A short walk from downtown (20 minutes)


Small park, not very green maybe because of the fact it's October. With some steps that leads you to the beach. Above average to navigate through the logs.


More a walking path than a park but this beach front area is a must any time of the year to take in the classic views from Victoria.

be cautious if your going. I'll be avoiding this park.


Was a great walk, but the paths inside need some suring up from the crd, as right now as the snow is melting and when it rains some of the upper hills turn to mud.  Which makes it quite hard to traverse.


Love this park...go there all the time...love to c all he different dogs play everyone is very friendly


You are allowed to have your dog off-leash on the small patch of grass, and it is called ""Dog Park"" on google - so I guess it is technically a dog park - just not a very good one.

This was my second attempt at strolling through this area. I came a few weeks ago but the park was locked off with police tape due to an officer being attacked. The area is super quiet and seems like a nice place to relax. There is a beautiful view of the water and it has a floating dock the you can swim out too as well. Great place for walking or riding a bike as it leads out to the Selkirk Trestle.

This park has really well-maintained grass and softball areas. My dog and I walk through there often, and he likes to lay down on the grass in the shady areas. At the other end, though, is the fairly run-down tennis/pickleball courts, lacrosse box, and compound for basketball and kids' activities. I don't have much need to go into these areas, but despite being in need of an update, they are highly popular. And there's the kids' water park that was always a great experience for my kids when they were younger!

Nice park for children. They leave lots of sand toys out for the kids which I thought was very kind and cool!


Really great park for kids of all ages, everything from sandbox to roll-on play structures to climbing walls, multiple metal slides, a fun rope balance swing, few different style swings.

'Tis a nice little park. I would rate this a ""mature/ young-mature dog friendly park"" as it is not enclosed, and there are usually children at play in the playground. If you want to bring your child or children to this park, be wary of dog poop, and sticks (and pinecones) laying around, as they can be hazardous (and smelly). During the rain season, I notice that near the playground, there is a small bump in the grass that gets very muddy at it's base, so make sure you are wearing the right footwear needed if you intend on walking around in the rain. Happy walks!


Great park, open field for activities, play ground and so trees for shade. Bring some layers because the park is close to the water and can get windy at times!

A nice alternative for views to Mount Douglas park.


My favourite neighbourhood park! Gary oaks that look spooky in autumn, berries along the reservoir all summer, and birds year-round. Beautiful mural on the tower and incredible sunset views.


This park changes with the seasons and offers both grand vistas and an opportunity to see beautiful wild flora. Easy walking paths wander through glades of Garry Oak and rock out-cropping. A small play ground, makes this a perfect park to take the family out to experience some Victorian nature and to gain some perspective. There is something magical about the place.


I absolutely love this part but the only reason it doesn't get 5 stars because sometimes the animal control patrol officers hang out there accosting people and putting everyone on edge.


Summit Park is a little known jewel in Victoria. It's larger than you might guess and it is filled with the undeniable charm of Garry Oaks. The views are beautiful and it is right next to a main water reservoir. A fantastic place to visit!

Eggs Benedict are great and big for one person, but I would say bowls are for two, they're huge!
French toast is a mots I would say, we tried the apple one and it was unbelievable!

The Veggie Omelet is also quite enjoyable here. The cheese ontop the egg is notably flavorful with the basil pesto.

Very understanding and accommodating for those of use that have allergies.


It was perfect place with baby. My friend took her 10 weeks girl. The staffs was so nice and kind. We ordered 3 kinds of dishes. All good. Yummy with good coffee! It was first time visiting. Park also convinced.


Amazing! We've visited the Ruby on Johnson, and had an incredible breakfast before, so we figured we'd try this location too.

Incredible (seriously) service, with 100-watt smiles. Not sure what our server's name was, but she absolutely earned her Wonder Woman tattoo (thank you again for a wonderful experience)!

The food was as delicious (and filling) as our previous experience. The mountains of waffles had our kids on cloud nine, while the breakfast tacos were a slam dunk for the grown ups. I'm not sure what they were called, but the ones with bacon are absolutely phenomenal - especially when drizzled with their homemade garlic hot sauce.

Yeah, we'll be back, all right. :)


What an awesome little gem hidden in plain sight, lol! Didn't have to wait too long for a table. Service was top notch, friendly, and prompt. I'm a Waffle üßá/ Pancake ü•û girl and The Ruby did not disappoint me. Caramelized bananas üçå, roasted pecans and bourbon syrup, on top of a stack of mouth watering waffles üßá. Hubby had an omelet with bacon ü•ì, mushrooms üçÑ, and cheese üßÄ.
Thank you Ruby!!!! ‚úåÔ∏è

Main complaint/ thing I wish they would change is that they use farmed salmon :(
Would love to see them serve WILD salmon & not support the fish farm industry!


A cozy diner-esque caf√©, tucked just off of Shelbourne on church Ave, this little caf√© serves up full breakfast and lunch meals along with espresso drinks and drip coffee. Upon entering there is a display of fresh, house-baked goods on the counter, right beside the till. I tried the cranberry and almond muffin (which was massive), a latte, and a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon added.
The coffee was standard issue, although I could tell the quality of the espresso was good. My latte was nice and smooth, with a good amount of foam. I hate overly sweet baked goods, and the muffin was not that. It was sweetened nicely with lots of almond slivers and cranberries, and was served with butter on the side. Muffins are warmed quickly in the microwave for each customer which is appreciated for that freshly baked feel.
Urban cup uses bagels from a local bagel-maker called mt.royal bagels. They're OK, in my opinion, but the smoked salmon is awesome! For $7.50 (plus $2.50 for the bagel itself), you get a generous side portion of cream cream cheese, a big, thick cut of smoked salmon, topped with red onion and arugula. The whole affair is served so you can build it yourself if you're taking it to stay. The salmon is slightly sweet, with a great Smokey flavour throughout. Being a thicker piece of salmon is appreciated, vs. the usual few paper-thin slices. The whole thing is delicious and I highly recommend trying the salmon and bagel.
Atmosphere is nothing special. The caf√© is in a bright location with indoor and outdoor seating. The caf√© is right beside Shelbourne which is a very busy main thoroughfare without many trees or bushes to deaden the sound for outdoor tables, so individual mileage may vary with the outdoor seating.

Overall, very cozy digs with good coffee, and a great salmon and cream cheese bagel. Try the fresh baked goods of the day. There are bigger breakfast and lunch menu items that I will be trying on later visits. 8.5/10


Never been here before and my husband and I were ignored üôÅ at the cash register for close to 5 minutes. I get that you're busy, but at least
train your staff to acknowledge people within the first 40 seconds of entering your establishment that they'll be right with you. But to be ignored üôÅ?
Our food arrived promptly but wasn't impressed with the eggs Benedict and hashbrowns. Oh well you win some you lose some.


One of my favorite stops on this end of town! Anywhere I can get an omelete after work is perfect to me! Staff are really great and they've done a great renovation fairly recently. So glad to support this business. Food is great and so is the coffee and baked goods!!!


Cute little coffee shop to start off the day! Loved their latte‚Äôs, and they have a variety of other great drinks as well. I had the The smoked meat sandwich with a side of hash browns. I enjoy the use of a burger bun instead of regular bread. Breakfast was great along side my latte.

Food is a little pricy and the portions are small compared to other areas.
I really enjoy having a morning cup while I do some work!

The decor and vibe of this restaurant is awesome along with great service.the staff was also very accommodating for dietary restrictions.

They also have a small boutique where you can purchase scrubs, stationery, apparel, accessories and candles

We ordered:

-  ""The Vacation"" pressed juice - perfect if you want a sweet and refreshing drink
- Breakfast burger with truffle fries
- Mushroom toast with cashew cheese


I‚Äôve been in this restaurant twice: once sat outside and once inside.
Pros: food is delicious and healthy,
Service is nice and friendly,
Decor and furniture is modern and relaxing colours,
Outside patio with heater,
Some beautiful and cute merchandise.

Con: there is something wrong with audio insulation of the restaurant that makes it very noisy. So if you need a cosy and quiet place that you can chat easily with friends, it‚Äôs better to sit outside.


Have been meaning to check it out for awhile now. Only a forty minute wait to get a table on late Saturday morning. Great coffee selection. Food came to the table quickly. Both the breakfast sandwich and the tuna salad were delicious. Will definitely go back.


There was a big line up at our favourite brunch spot so we searched for another place nearby that offered hot breakfasts. The decor at Bear & Joey was a little too pink, gold and palm treed for us but we were hungry. Too bad the mushroom toast was sold out. Service was fine, food was nicely prepared and presented but we needed the jaws of life to break through the crust on the artisan toast. üòÜüòÅ


Bear & Joey is one of my favourite brunch restaurants in Victoria! I‚Äôd say the best patio setup with heaters if needed, allows for dogs / has water station, excellent service and professionalism. We had the Avocado Toast and added prosciutto, and the PotatoRosti and added the bacon + avocado. The bacon literally melts in your mouth, it‚Äôs so good. Coffee and Kombucha also a great choice! Highly recommend.

I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and will have to return! I had an amazing experience.


Definitely a great place to bring a large group of friends on a weekend or Friday night. Very lovely place with great mood and a decent bar. My burger was decent, nothing special or anything but was definitely satisfying, but I would recommend their lime pie! Not too sweet with great texture.

Amazing experience to dine here awesome food. It‚Äôs location is so perfect we landed up going here twice in 3 days üòÄ The food is delicious highly recommend the veg lasagna for vegetarians. Chicken parmesan had the crispiest chicken and all flavours came so well together. Also the fish and chips. The best was key lime pie ü§§. Must visit when in Victoria.


One of the few places which have decent options for vegetarians! The staff is amicable and made us feel very comfortable. We ordered mushroom skillets, curried penne and vegetarian lasagna. Mushroom skillet was delicious and better than expectations. Curried penne wasn‚Äôt great, but the vegetarian lasagna was amazing!! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and had a satisfying meal. Would definitely visit more to check out the other dishes.


Frankie's is a must go if you are visiting Victoria, the location is perfect as you will definitely find yourself walking up and down Government street and the diner is just there.

The menu is vast and cover much, if not all, you'd expect a dinner to serve. The food has always been amazing on every visit and the service very friendly and welcoming.

If you find yourself lost on so many options, go for the mimosas, classic burger with fries and a slice of that amazing key lime pie.

I went on a Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. No line-up today. It's always packed on the weekends because it is so good. Decent prices, excellent quality and funky atmosphere.
The portions are more than average in my opinion. We both brought home half of our meal.


This is a 6 out of 5 stars place. We had the mini-pancakes, the Side-Chick and the Champignon burger. All 3 were delicious. Definitely worth checking out. The decor is cool as well and the staff is nice. Beware that there may be a lineup, but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs good.


I want to give Spoons a million stars. This is hands-down one of the best breakfast restaurants in Victoria. The weekly specials are always well thought out and absolutely delicious! The Bailey's benny is one of my favourite things on the menus. The decor is funky and vibrant. They have trivia to keep you entertained at the tables, which is super fun. At peak hangover breakfast time this place can get busy, so be prepared for a line-up. TRUST ME THOUGH, it's worth the wait.


Nice central location with ample free parking. The restaurant is painted in bright colors, it is not very specious, the tables are somewhat packed. We ordered Bangkok Benny and waffle with berry and cream. They both were good but the cream on top of waffle was amazing. The servers were polite and professional. Usually there is a long line up during weekends. Nothing wrong about the restaurant but it was too crowded for me so 4 out of 5 for this reason.


Loved the decor, but then I‚Äôm a bit of a comics geek. Regardless, the food was all amazing and not overpriced. Friendly waitstaff, thanks mamapinkiepie! The sweet prusa for us was a stack of massive chocolate chip pancakes with a peanut butter glaze, yummy! We flipped for it and won the toss!

We weren‚Äôt sure if this is where we wanted to stop for lunch, but we were glad we did! The staff was very helpful and enthusiastic about our menu choices, and gave us a good timeframe for when we‚Äôd get our food.

The curried egg sandwich was fresh and light, made with their house-made bread. The salad was also really nice and very tasty. Glad we stopped in for a bite!


I‚Äôve been here three times for the chicken soup with rice. I really enjoy it and its a great portion for the price.

Cute cafe and it‚Äôs a nice vibe for cozy.


This is the perfect stop for a quick bite while you‚Äôre out running errands or doing homework. I tried the chicken pozole and a slice of the banana bread. The soup was absolutely amazing! I got a cup of the soup and you have an option for a side of bread or rice. I tried the bread and it was so fresh and went great with the soup. The banana bread wasn‚Äôt the best, it was a little tough to bite into, but I did order it in the afternoon. The cafe itself has only a few tables for mostly groups or two, but many seemed to be available when I went. Will definitely be stopping by again!


This is the best cappuccino I've ever had! Very friendly service and a relaxing atmosphere. The foccacia bread can only be described as ""magical"". The sandwich is bursting with flavour. I would give this breakfast 6 stars if I could. Pictured here, is the half devoured cappuccino, Mama Linda's Baked Eggs, and a jalapeno foccacia to go.

Rise and Grind on Broad Street is easily my favourite go-to casual breakfast, brunch, and coffee destination in downtown Victoria. The food options are diverse and made to order, plus the brewed fresh Discovery Coffee is always a hit. Highly recommended, never disappointed.


Finally after 2 years living downtown I have found a coffee shop that is absolutely wonderful. They have excellent breakfast, amazing/healthy lunch options and more. The staff are nice and welcoming, and not snobby or pretentious like many of the other coffee/breakfast spots downtown Victoria. Excellent location too!! Look forward to coming to Rise and Grind (almost) every morning. Thank you for your great cafe and service!!


Wow amazing breakfast sandwich I had there. Their ingredients were super fresh and of high quality, the recipe and choice of ingredients were a perfect blend of flavor which delivered an harmonious taste experience. The portion was satisfying and the price decent.
I recommend.


I like this coffee place, it provides great food and they make it in front of you. It is freshly made and delicious. Great location in downtown. Love it!!! I came here for a few times and could not forget about it.

What makes the Ruby stand out the most is it‚Äôs service. As studies who are high broke, our waitress was very considerate in all aspects. Not only was the service great, but she took the time to get to know us as well!

Fun facts! There is even live music and in comparison to other similar restaurants the wait time to get a seat is relatively short.


This place is spectacular. I'm a big breakfast guy and actively seek out good breakfast joints.  This is by far my favorite in Victoria. The service, the food, the atmosphere, and the fact they're open early (early bird here).

I got the brisket hash which was absolutely amazing. I love hash and the two poached eggs over brisket with crispy potato hash was the perfect meal after my morning workout.


We just waited for less than 10 minutes around 10 o‚Äôclock. Bright and cosy, nice services , yummy food! Berry  waffle recommended! For me, I prefer the Ruby more than Blue Fox!


You definitely gotta try this out!! We knew this diner has a special history which I can tell why locals keep coming back. Mesmerizing decor and menu is extensive; it was hard to decide where to sit and what to order. We tried their delicious breakfast menu. Generous portion and we were so full that we needed to walk it out. The staff was humble and all their recommendations were spot on. Must try !!


I think I just had the most perfect breakfast at The Ruby. After torturing myself by having to choose just ONE meal off their extensive menu, the Brisket Benny was a top notch choice. It was absolutely wonderful! The atmosphere was absolutley perfect for a leisurely Saturday breakfast, made extra perfect by the live musician sporting an acoustic guitar. I'll be in a good mood for the rest of the day, courtesy of The Ruby.

amazing servers and lovely atmosphere - got a chai latte which was delicious and the southern belle eggs benedict with scottish potato scone. I wasn't the biggest fan of the eggs benedict but it was just not the flavour combo for me! would have loved another type for sure


Best Benedict eggs I have ever had. They have different hollandaise sauce which makes them more interesting to try. I ordered the clubhouse and I loved it. The boy serves very well but the girl needs to be more friendly. I give them 5 stars because the flavour is extremely good.

Waited 30 minutes for a bacon and avocado sandwhich while the owner walked around behind the counter eating (not food safe) berating his staff. Really unimpressed with this location and service.

They have wide variety of food choices for brunch. My sister and I love their pancakes with maple syrup cream cheese, the combination is really good.

The servers are also friendly and welcoming. It could be because there are many people that come here for brunch especially during the weekend and there's usually a line up that we feel that the servers are in a hurry for you to pay for your food so you can go and let others Seat. My sister hasn't even finished her coffee when the server came with the card machine and asked us if we are ready to pay. If you want a more relax place or a space where you can chat more with your friends or love ones over brunch,  maybe this is not the place for you. But if it is just brunch that you want to try, John's could provide that for you.


We have been here a few times now and it never disappoints!  My husband and I had the vegan burrito and it was incredible! Whatever was in it was very tasty and kept us full all day. I can‚Äôt wait to have it again :-)  the portions are generous!

This is one of the hot brunch restaurants in Victoria.  Place opens 8am in the morning and there was already many people waiting well before the opening time.  Food was very good.  Sandwich was lunch menu but still was able to order it in the morning.  Price is fair as well.  Parking are on street, so ensure to pay at the meter station.


One of those rare times the lineup wasn't very long so we took advantage.  It's a busy spot but the service was efficient and the food came out quickly.  I had the Angel Eyes Eggs Benny.  The eggs were perfectly cooked.  The homefries were crispy.  Didn't find it had oodles of flavour, but of course that has more to do with my choice of order.  My friend had the Moroccan Chicken Club which he really liked.  Will go back, but likely not when it's lined up.


If you can tolerate the wait, you‚Äôll be rewarded with a table. Saturday morning lineup 10:20, seated at 11:10 ordered and food arrived 11:30. Real breakfast potatoes is a good sign.

What a wonderful time and experience in Victoria.

Our eyes could not avert the beautiful hot pink colour that was this little diner. Floyd's has a great menu with breakfast brunch and lunch items and the staff are so kind. We ordered the chicken and waffles Benny and the BC hash and the portions are very generous and reasonable. Each dish still comes in around 18-20$ but we felt it was worth it. Highly recommend if you're in the area. As an additional note, the washrooms are tiny and I would say accessibility wise it is a little tight. They also have seating outdoors which is quite nice.

The restaurant itself is very eclectic, with a friendly and nostalgic atmosphere ‚Äî magenta exterior, mismatched artwork on the walls, no frills decor and aesthetic. Super friendly service, servers had lots of suggestions for things to do in the city. Good prices and honestly really great breakfast ‚Äî serving up that thicc bacon, they don‚Äôt mess around. Darn good eggs, and what I believe to be house made or locally made sour dough (honestly some of the best sourdough ever). Can‚Äôt wait to go back next time I visit the island


I tried the vegetarian hash... it tasted good. The salsa was really yummy. The potatoes were crispy. The rest of the food : poutine and the lumberjack was tasty too. The food was fresh and the portion was good for 2. They also have bottomless coffee for 4.25..
The staff was friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this diner. They serve all day breakfast and lunch. The wait time for a table was 10 minutes. Street parking available.

Food was great but quite a large menu so I would suggest looking at it before coming here. Fruit was nice and fresh. My partners ham was a little overcooked and the coffee was a little watered down but I enjoyed the experience.


Best breakfast in Victoria- you can get anything you want from omelettes to pancakes and French toast, sandwiches, and so much more. The ingredients are so fresh and the fruit they serve is making - melons, berries - even gooseberries- kiwi, banana and more . This is just the side fruit that comes with the meal.  Simple decor , friendly staff - definitely a destination for an amazing breakfast


This restaurant/ server gave us such a weird vibe. The server did all the regular work, but he was grumpy. He wanted us to order quick, eat extremely quick and leave even the restaurant is not busy (weekday 12 to 1pm).

To Owner: thank you for your reply and kind offer. Just hope this is just individual situation.


Large menu with kids menu as well. Food is OK and prices are OK although sides and coffee are a bit pricy. We had 2 coffees ($7) 2 adult meals, 1 kids meal, and 2 sides - total was $58 before tip. Decent place for breakfast if you're craving that.


Love the fluffy blueberry pancake! The chorizo and goat cheese crepomelette has a mix of salty and sour taste. It was the first time for us to try crepomelette (omelette stuffed jn a crepe). Quite special. The portion of food is large and definitely gives you a satisfactory morning!

Just.so.good.


My family and I decided to stop in for brunch and we were all surprised at how delicious the food and coffee was. The staff were very friendly, the atmosphere was nice and they had good music playing too!


Food is good, the burrito was very flavourful and wrapped well. Giving it 4 stars only because they automatically charge you 15% for tips. The only service we got was the staff bringing out our food to the table. Not sure if that warrants a 15% mandatory tip.


Funky decor, good menu. Both the Owen and the Weekender were really tasty, though the 'smashed potatoes' were just cooked potatoes without any smash in sight? Didn't love the single-use packaging when we ate on site - hopefully just a COVID thing.


My dad and I were visiting Victoria on our way to shop RVs for my parents across the island. Dad ate the Vegan Hash, which he said was so delicious, large portion and very filling, while I shopped a few stores nearby. As I finished, I returned for a Chai Tea Latte with oat milk and it was also well done; flavorful, smooth and creamy. Would visit again next trip!

I was greeted by a gentleman (presuming Jay) who kindly explained the early opening so decided to come in to shelter myself from the wind & drizzling rain.

The food was good; came fast so technically one can quickly eat and go if they're on a time pinch. That is usually me but today I decide to take it slow to absorb the jazz music and the ambiance. Listening to Unforgettable & Just the Two of Us kinda made me think this would've been a good place to bring my former boyfriend (the person with me in my reviews all these years until recently) but his loss.

Anyway the sun mysterious shone momentarily as I am ready to get ready to watch the parade. I appreciate this place getting me the glass of water and allowing me to have an entire room to relax and enjoy my meal. I'll make sure to bring my performing daughters here on my next visit. My only suggestion to the cafe is update the social media more as it has outdated information and perhaps use some furniture felt to balance some of the table feet that has cardboard and folded paper underneath them. üòÇ

Also to the one person who left the awful review saying Cheese Whiz was used for the ingredient, you need to get your olfactory bulb and eyes checked. It is beyond obvious cheddar cheese üßÄ the ingredient used in the menu. Just look at my wrap; it's obvious standard, medium sharpness flavor.

What a cute little spot to drop in for a coffee. Or wine. Or a snack. Delightful sitting out front. But even better seating out back in a garden like atmosphere. Service was great..

I just loved how old the building and how well kept up it was.


Imagine living every day like you‚Äôre on a quaint British seaside holiday‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs Windsor Cafe.

The building exterior has Tudor-style design & the atmosphere is perfect for reading a good book or sitting down with friends‚Ä¶ jazzy music, a fireplace, an interesting menu with a hearty soup that changes daily, large windows. Perfect if you‚Äôre visiting Willows Beach. If I lived in Victoria I would absolutely come back regularly.


The third photo in Google maps looked like pork belly on mashed potatoes. Silly me ‚Äì going there thinking that I could get the same dish. Nope. They had to scale down the cooking and serve more simple food after the pandemic. So, we ordered Chicken Club Sandwiches, our third one in one week! Well, they win hands down, this was the most delicious Chicken Club Sandwich I've tasted in a long while. Moist, tasty chicken, enough fresh greens and mayo. Can't say the same for the latte or cappuccino, the espresso was not pressed down enough, and foaming was very weak. As for seating, at one point, it seemed like my sandwich was going to be stolen by a visiting dog. That's casual outside seating. Five stars for the Chicken Club, minus one star for the terrible coffee drinks.


Coffee was good, bagels were fine, but there seems to be missing a character. Staff needs to be more like Shirley Delicious. Next to Windsor Park is a huge bonus.

I had the Farmhouse Classic and an iced hazelnut latte. The sandwich was a good portion, piled with ingredients, super tasty. It was a little spicy from the Serrano Mayo but not in an overpowering way. The ingredients were very fresh and the bun was soft and held up well. The latte was also very good. The coffee was smooth and they offer alternative milks with no additional up charge. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a good breakfast spot!


Breakfast at Farmhouse Victoria is the best place to start the day, I love it for space, place, local food and the girls than run the show! Every item served is local, they are great ambassadors of locally sourced food; from the bread to the home cured bacon, to the locally roasted beans to the made in house treats. They make your orders on the go, so be prepared to wait a bit because, oh my, the few minutes wait is so worth it. Sit on the patio and enjoy the view of the water and the busy people going by, and the flower power of Local Restaurant next door. People are nice in Victoria, really and truly‚Ä¶but the ladies at this place take the cake award when it comes to niceness.


Very tasty breakfast sandwich this morning. If you want something light and not too heavy this is the place to go.


They have really, really good coffee and sandwiches here.  I went  back a couple of times. They have breakfast sandwiches that are popular and also lunch sandwiches. They are delicious and huge!  Everything is really fresh. They also have really good muffins as well, I had a coffee cake one and it was really tasty.

We particularly like the eggs Benny, which are prepared with a delicious cashew cream sauce. The seedy bread is also terrific. The coffee drinks are especially creative and are served with beautiful flourishes of design and usually edible flowers. The manager, Amira, is so incredibly kind and attentive. All in all, this is a wonderful restaurant.


Gem of gems in Victoria and probably in BC as a whole. Exquisite presentation all around, both in the beautiful plating of the kitchen selections and the layout of the place. The cafe drinks in particular were stunning, visually speaking.

What truly makes this place stand out is the homemade quality of what seems to be the most fresh ingredients‚Ä¶ both plates we had were delicately crafted: ample sweetness, tasteful seasonings, beautiful pairing of ingredients, humble portions, and a soaring sense of ‚Äúfreshness.‚Äù While prices are justifiably premium, it is more than fair considering the relentless quality of every offering on the menu and sincerity of the staff.

All around, an incredibly memorable and enjoyable dining experience. Quite the standout in what might be one of the best spots on the island!


The cutest heritage house with delicious brunch made with fresh local ingredients. We had the half and half (pancake and half Benny), the golden Benny and their bone broth. Everything was colourful, flavourful, and high quality. Highly recommend you go at least 15min before they open so you can snag the first seating.


Very unique menu! Beautiful location. I got the dandelion beverage with chaga (in photos) and was pleasantly surprised as to how tasty it was! The coffees and broths were also great quality. I had the tartine, my sister had sleeping beauty pancakes, and my dad had the golden Benny with extra bacon. Of the three, our favorite was the Benny (especially the bacon) and the pancakes. You will not be disappointed.


I went in skeptical. The menu online looked too healthy to be flavourful. Boy was I wrong! The oat pancakes were light as air. Everything was tasty. Incredible bacon. Good cup of coffee. Highly recommend!

It is in more of an industrial area, but I'm happy we drove over.  They have a great outside patio area, as well as some seating inside.  (Not a lot, bit some!)

The staff are very friendly!  There is an extensive beverage menu, hot and cold, as well as fresh baking, and a daily soup and food special.

Today we had donairs (I loved that you got a choice between Halifax sauce and tzatziki!).  We had a side of beef barley soup and fries.  We both really enjoyed our meals!  Flavourful meat, fresh pita and veggies, and just the right amount of sauce!  The fries were fresh and crisp, and the soup was amazing!  Really filling portion, lots of herbs, veggies and meat to make it very flavourful!

It does get really busy over the lunch hour, which does lead to it being chilly when the door is open lots.  The food was worth it though, and we will happily be back again!

I decided to try the harvest breakfast and it did not disappoint! It was a tasty dish with a hint of spice that gave it an extra kick. I also loved the homemade salsa sauce - it was so good that I ended up buying a bottle to take home with me.

The service was also very friendly and fast. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and welcoming, and it was right next to the sea which.

For dessert, I decided to try the churros pancakes which were simply delicious. However, I must say that they were a bit too sweet for my taste.

Additionally, there were plenty of parking spots available right in front of the restaurant which made it very convenient. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast with a great view and friendly service.


Nice spot for breakfast. Little benches at the front of the building for when you‚Äôre lining up. The service was excellent, from suggestions on what to eat, keeping the coffee topped up and having hand sanitizers at the end of the meal. It‚Äôs busy especially on weekends but worth it.


Enjoyed breakfast at Fuego Old Town Eatery, fantastic service and beautifully spicy breakfast meal. Enjoyed the Fuego Benny with Cornbread. Very tasty with the house habanero sauce. We also had a fantastic view of the Johnson Street Bridge raising while enjoying our meal.

Cute interior, central location, good service. I got the Montr√©al smoked meat sandwich and squash curry soup - The smoked meat isn't Schwartz or Dunn's quality but it was still good. The soup was delish.


Literally my favourite place to get food in Victoria. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is THE BEST there is. Always SUPER FRESH AND TASTY. my favourite things are their Montreal meat sandwich with their homemade sweet and spic.  Plus their chicken noodle soup reminds me of something my mom makes when I‚Äôm sick but even better. ( sorry mom). The chicken strips are like no others you‚Äôve had in the city. They are buttery and taste like the are made fresh as well. The portions are HUGE and I can‚Äôt get over how delicious everything is. I‚Äôve tried quite a few of the deserts and of course they do not disappoint. They taste homemade and so fresh.  The Halong Bay Salad is something I tried new and of course it was exceptional like everything I‚Äôve ever tried. Their food is worth every penny and I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I‚Äôd start with the Montreal meat sandwich with homemade sweet and spicy mustard. You‚Äôll thank me later. I‚Äôve tried so many delis and sandwiches in Victoria since I‚Äôve lived here my whole life and NOTHING EVEN COMES CLOSE TO THEIR INSANELY , DELICIOUS FOOD WHICH WILL HAVE YOU COMING BACK FOR MORE. I ORDER AT LEAST 1-3x a week it‚Äôs that good ( even if I don‚Äôt eat it that day I know it‚Äôs made fresh so I can keep it in my fridge for the next day or 2 and it still tastes phenomenal). Also the customer service is amazing. Tron goes above and beyond to make his customers happy. Trust me when I say it‚Äôs one of Victoria‚Äôs best kept secrets. I promise you‚Äôll be so happy with any food item you choose and they have something for everyone !! Try it ASAP


I got their daily lunch special which I believe is the Montreal beef sandwich. Bread's really soft and fresh and the meat was succulent and fully loaded (ordered the super size). Polished off the coleslaw which tells you something because I usually despise coleslaw in general, and the chips are good sized and crisp. Owners running the shop are very polite and the food was made to order at a very decent speed (wife at the shop slicing away at the mandolin while husband was chatting with me and the work colleague who recommended this place to try)

For those who are griping about pricing of food... seriously, use your thinking caps on. Rent ain't cheap and they're in a prime location. They're not a franchise or a chain, and there is a lot of overhead plus the rising costs of food ingredients in general. It causes me to facepalm when shoddy reviewers make an incredible poor comparison when their education is lower than a 10th grader and have absolute zero business knowledge. The pricing is on par with the value of the entrees.

Anyway, keep up with the good work. I probably can't afford it on a daily basis because I'm usually a glutton with good food nowadays and can easily burn a hole if I'm not careful but definitely worth it as a weekly or monthly treat for me.


Good mom and pop style food. Decent price and easy going owner.
I would go back for sure. If you want to avoid another Chain breakfast join, go here.

This is a very unique place! Oldest building in Oak Bay. A YUGE menu, which can be daunting to get through, but everything we had was quite tasty! Fair prices, electric crowd, warm service. More than meets the eye!


A lovely & charming restaurant with delicious brunch selections. First time, I had the Veggie Benedict, and another time, the massive Veggie Omelette.  Both items were delicious.  Servers were efficient and friendly. The only minor ""complaint"" would be the Red Rose tea. The choice for their black tea was a bit disappointing for a Tea Room.  However, their rich and decadent chocolate brownie made up for it. ;)


Went there on a Sunday, just me. They took forever to seat me. I ordered a coffee and the shortrib eggs benny, the first mug she gave had a lipstick mark on which was replaced when asked. The eggs benny there was plenty of shortrib but lacking of flavor and salt! I don't usually add extra salt after food is served but I had to. The only tasty thing was their parmesan potatoes!

And you can‚Äôt beat eating outside by the water.


This caf√© has changed hands over the years, but in its latest iteration it is known as the Marina Dockside Eatery.

I am here on a Thursday morning, just after opening.  There are about ten patrons here, enjoying coffees, pastries, and food.  There is also takeout available.

I‚Äôve spotted a Kindle, a magazine, and the Times Colonist newspaper being read.  Quiet music is being played and only the sounds of conversation, and refreshments being made behind the counter,  are heard.

Outside the entire expanse of windows that wrap around the caf√© are sailboats, other patrons on the terrace, and those who work nearby.

Altogether a lovely spot for this morning‚Äôs cappuccino, which is good, but not quite strong enough for my taste.

Update:  All of my cappuccinos have been superb since.  Well done, baristas!

The caf√© offers breakfast, teas, coffees, wraps, sandwiches, chowder, soups, and other similar fare.

While it has a good ambience, the d√©cor could use a bit of an update.  It is mainly beige walls, fairly modern chairs and tables, though, there is a definite overdraft of beige and brown.  Some pop of colour would be welcomed; even some nautical d√©cor - not the tacky type - but some better pieces.

If you‚Äôre driving, just park at Turkey Head and walk down to the caf√©, or else use the ramp if need be.  Buses also stop at Turkey Head.

The Marina restaurant, just up the ramp,  just recently closed its doors, but the last time I was there for a meal it was far too quiet and the food wasn‚Äôt altogether anything to write home about, so to speak.  It was an icon, certainly, but time moves on.

I will definitely return to this caf√©.  A relaxing place, overall and friendly, chatty, staff.


Breakfast bun was great! Banana bread okay. Service was hands off for amount of people working. This place IS open even tho they don't answer the phone and one of the dockside restaurants says they are closed (its upstairs)


Friendly staff, good London fog, excellent salmon seafood chowder. I would definitely have that chowder again. Perfect comfort food on a chilly afternoon.


We had a lovely breakfast here, very relaxed atmosphere, staff were friendly and beautiful views of the Marina.

Red Kettle is a cozy restaurant, not too fancy, simple atmosphere, service and food are great though! Run by the owners, they really make the difference. Great service for a good cost.


This unassuming little hideaway in the commercial district of Victoria offers the fast solution for the ""working man's"" appetite. Burgers, sandwiches and an all day breakfast seem to the mainstay of this establishment plus the constant flow of customers picking up take out orders. The portions are always on the larger side just by looking at what orders were nearby. I ordered an omelette and it was ok, nothing special. The decor would have been appropriate for the 70's but the food arrives fast. Order at the counter and self serve for coffee. I'd go back.

I've been Pescatarian for a little over a year now, but I'm trying to fully transition to vegetarian, which can make it hard to dine with the gf at times since we like to share food for variety. So unfortunately I feel like I might not be doing this restaurant any justice since it has such an interesting and very tempting menu full of meat options. Anyway...pictured in this review is the vegetarian hash and the pancake special (pretty much banana pancakes with walnuts).

Vegetarian Hash - I've never had a hash with spring-mix on top. Usually vegetarian hashes are just peppers and onions, but this was more like a salad with egg and hashbrowns. Still really good once you chop everything up together and dump some hot sauce and ketchup on it. I'd order it again.
The Pancakes - They looked dense but they were so fluffy and their syrup was awesome. I could have taken a shot of just the syrup.

I'd definitely return. It's in a really cool spot called Market Square too. On a sunny day its just a nice place to eat hang out in.


The food and attention was very good.  They should check the ventilation system since the fry from the kitchen is in the restaurant. Our eyes were watering and our throats were constantly burning.  Our clothes smelled of frying, it was necessary to wash our clothes when we got home since the smell we had was incredible.  At the moment they opened the doors to ventilate but this made us all very cold.  The truth is that if it wasn't for this problem, everything would be perfect


Very comfortable and homey with friendly servers. My wife thinks of herself as an expert on biscuits and gravy and said these were the best she‚Äôs ever had. My omelette and hash browns were excellent and well prepared.

We went in on a wet, cold day and had a bowl of chili and a bowl of chicken stew soup. They were both delicious, you can tell they were homemade. Very pleasant staff. A bit pricey but I think it's like that everywhere now. $13 for a bowl of soup/stew. We were very pleased overall.


I can't say enough AMAZING things about this place! I ordered through skip, had never heard of them and took a chance! I'm so happy I did! One of my new favourite places to add to my list! I order a lot of skip for my picky eater mom in long-term care and she LOVED everything from turkey, brie + spinach sandwich on rye to the coconut chicken soup and even the Cobb Salad! A great way to get her to eat her veggies!

Thank you Soupa team and for double checking the receipt to make sure I had everything for my order! You will definitely hear from me again very soon! Through skip  and hopefully in person sometime in the near future.

Love the real turkey in the sandwich and Cobb salad! Best bacon I have ever had!
I'm going to tell everyone to go here!


Let's get to the point: this was the best breakfast bagel I've ever had. The food in this new little restaurant is exquisite, seemingly simple yet beautifully flavoured. As for options, there seem to be a humble yet varied menu of both classics and vegetarian options available, and the staff were more than willing to accommodate me when I mentioned an allergy. I wish I could show you a picture of what I chose, but I ate it too fast! But suffice to say, the breakfast egg'n'bacon bagel is well worth your time.

The staff here are very friendly and helpful. They brought me my breakfast within short order, and checked up on me after to see how I was doing and to make sure i was enjoying myself. I was! The interior is clean and simple as well, nothing dramatic or overstated, although the table art is very fun to look at.  Fairly spacious too. It's a bit like a diner, fresh and to the point, but much less greasy.

In short, don't pass by this little place if you can help it. It's a little startup with a big heart, and it shows in the taste of what you eat.


Had dinner tonight at the new Esquimalt Rd location. Probably the best customer service I have ever had! Soups were phenomenal. The gentleman behind the counter let me try samples of the soups before I made my choice.

They were out of the mulligatawny (sp?) so I tasted the African Peanut and the Creamy Mushroom. That mushroom soup was the best I have ever had. Unbelievably good food. Had the Turkey Bacon sandwich on gluten free bread which was delicious as well. They even wrap the bread before toasting to eliminate any cross-contamination (I am celiac). So glad I came here for dinner tonight!


We heard so many great things and were very eager to try out the newer Esquimalt location for our Friday night take out meal. The staff were amazing and friendly,  and the restaurant smelled amazing at time of pickup.

I tried the daily special, a 7 grain chicken soup, and my wife got the creamy mushroom. They both looked and smelled awesome, but after the first bite we were both really disappointed... all we could taste was salt. I've had canned soup with significantly less salt content. I was quite hungry, so despite this I finished it, but my wife could barely eat half. By the end of the night my joints felt swollen and my face was puffy, it was that salty.

I'm glad that so many people enjoy their products, local  businesses deserve that love, but  unfortunately,  we won't be going back.

The cinnamon buns are sooo delicious. I ordered 2 not long after they came out of the oven and I think they were the best I've ever eaten!! Still warm and soft! Worth the price! The chicken wrap was really yummy too, both of them were super fresh, but the cinnamon buns were definitely the highlight of my time at Bunny's kitcken!!


LOVE LOVE LOVE this cafe!
Visiting from Oregon for a few days and we came everyday.
The absolute BEST vegan breakfast sandwich ever!
Every dessert has been delicious!
What a little gem!


This is the best vegan food in Victoria! I love their breakfast sandwich and I recently had their vegan chicken chaser wrap and it was the most amazing thing I have ever eaten in my life. The dressing was so creamy and garlicy and rich and there was so much chicken and the chicken was mixed with a bunch of parmesan cheese it was so cheesy and delicious and I wish I could eat it everyday forever. This is a picture of one half because I devoured the first half but then realized it must be documented. Thank you Bunny's!


From a non-Vegan to the other non-vegans, don't sleep on this place! I love a good salad and a good veggie burger, let me tell you though, THE PICKLE BURGER is stunning. The patty itself is lovely but the accoutrements that they add to it make it really next level, it's pickly, garlicky, every bite was outstanding and it was filling to boot. The assorted Vegan treats (that would normally rely heavily on dairy) are also extremely good, like really, really good. I mentioned the salads, well let me elaborate, they are big which is nice, lots' of fun textures in there but what really puts them above (a lot) of other salad offerings is the outstanding dressings, my gosh. Truly stellar place.

And not expensive. My husband had a burger & macaroni cheese bites...also very yummy! Our server was great too. Would definitely come here again next visit to Victoria.


The food was great and it is awesome having a full service bar and restaurant in your hotel only a few steps from the elevator. The food presentation was perfect and the portions were large. I ate both breakfast and dinner here and was not disappointed. Where else can you get both chicken and waffles & red snapper fish and chips under the same roof?


I stopped by on an extremely hot day for lunch with a friend. The patio was great to sit on and has a great view of the inner harbor. You are able to see the sea plane come in and out. The food was also great, I had the falafel sliders, and they were great. Good atmosphere and the wait staff were very friendly and accommodating. Thank you.


Finally decided to come check out Bellevilles for brunch and my god it was delicious. We tried all of the specials they had on and we're not disappointed whatsoever. The food was top notch, the services was friendly, and the atmosphere was delightful. I will definitely be back!!

First time visit. Tried the vegetarian options as it was closer to lunch time.
The ""Mexican waffle"" was great and will highly recommend it. Try it with scrambled eggs.
The vegetarian was decent, but not much too rave about.


Fantastic waffles for a late night treat. The place could be cleaned and fixed up a bit, but let's be honest you're not there for the atmosphere.


Definitely one of the best waffle places in vic by far! The worker who was there was super nice, and definitely made the appearance of my waffle look super pretty and appetizing! It was super yummy and I‚Äôm so glad that this place is open till 4 am on Fridays and Saturday‚Äôs, because it definitely is a great midnight snack.

I‚Äôm just wondering why there‚Äôs only one worker though for the whole restaurant even though it‚Äôs late at night?


Worst gluten free ""waffle"" ever. It was a mushy cake. Softer and mushier than a pancake. Waffles should be crispy. I tried to eat it, but gave up. I should have turned around when I saw that the place was empty- clearly was for a reason. My partner had a non GF waffle was also disappointed in how undercooked his was.

Definitely recommended whether you're passing through, or if you live in the area, or just moved to the area and need a little spot. I'm a local, but I love our vast variety of coffee spots. It is so great to edit, meet people, and enjoy how humans exist.


My daughter just moved into the area so we thought we'd check it out. The chickpea egg skillet was delicious and the chia yogurt was good too but the London Fog and espresso were not drinkable. The service was ok, not bad, not great. We will ill try out other coffee shops before returning.


I like the atmosphere of Little June and the coffee is good. Unfortunately, I have a gluten allergy and have asked for gluten-free modifications to sandwiches, but have inconsistently received gluten-free products. Several times I've left with a sandwich I thought was GF only to go back and ask for a new one because the bread was not GF. They also have very few GF options in general.


Good coffee, great atmosphere! I could have sat in there and read for hours it was like being in a good friends living room. It gets super busy though so you have to get there early if you want a good table

The service was excellent and situational aware. We ordered 3 different appetizers to share and they all came really fast. Then for the main course we had lamb and scallop risotto. I have to admit that everything was delicious. I would love to come back soon!


Enjoyed dinner with my girlfriend on the water on a cold winter night with a magnificent view of the water even when it was snowing. Showed up with no wait and was seated immediately and coats were checked. Server did take some time to come but understandable that it was a full house and during the holidays not all staff were on duty. Ordered the Risotto and Short Rib Lasagna and was definitely not disappointed at all. Food tasted great and whole experience was just good stuff. Will definitely be back!


I went for my Partners birthday. It was our first time here, and we will definitely be returning. The atmosphere was great with the amazing views of the Harbour, and the food was amazing.

We shared the bread&butter and the Humboldt squid appetizers(get the squid, seriously). Then, she had the scallop w/mushroom risotto, and I had the lamb.

It's definitely a place to check out .


What an awesome suggestion by our wonderful realtor Dane Kingsbury of Victoria ( I need to write him a review next). Our excellent server Nevin made our lunch a really great one .  We were a group of 7 so open table wouldn't let me book 7 so I booked 4 and 3 and when I arrived and explained to the lovely hostess she found us 2 booths (back to back) with panoramic water views. The food was fantastic and I thought for the price....it was very reasonable. The salads were crisp and fresh, my son loved his wagyu beef burger, steaks were done with perfection, mussels divine ( Nevin brought us a spoon as he gave us a great tip cause the broth is incredible) . Thank for such a great dining experience and kudos to Nevin....he even gave us a good recommendation for his barber üòÜ.


Went for brunch today as I‚Äôve seen the brunch menu and was intrigued by the Braised Short Rib Hash. The brunch menu has a good selection of items with several options of Eggs Benedict and several other delicious sounding items but I was there for the Hash. I like to order any breakfast item with Hollandaise on the side so I can add as much or little as I want, plus I want to see the food before it‚Äôs covered in sauce. The meal arrived and it did not disappoint! The eggs were poached a perfect medium, the potato hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside (they looked homemade but I can‚Äôt say for sure and forgot to ask) and the aged cheddar was a nice touch. The star of the dish was the braised short rib - amazing! And they did not skimp on the portion! Every mouthful was flavorful and delicious! It was one of those memorable dishes that will bring me back.

On a related note, I was at B&B a week or so ago for Happy Hour  with my sister and mother and we enjoyed a selection of items from the Happy Hour menu and to say we enjoyed them immensely is an understatement. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get any pics but next time I go for their Happy Hour I‚Äôll be sure to get some good pics

Tried this spot for the first time, food was fantastic and good experience overall.

We went here on a Sunday morning at 9 and there was plenty of tables available.
We were greeted right away and offered water to start.

Once we had our orders placed, it took a bit of time for our food to arrive. There seemed to be two cooks in the kitchen. The food arrived and it was worth the longer wait. It had good flavour and was well presented.

I recommend this as a weekend breakfast spot!


I love Avalon. In terms of downtown breakfast places, it's slight out of the way... but that means it's rarely busy and there almost never a line. It's a small diner that serves hearty comfort food. They make their own oaten bread and jams. On my last visit, I had the Avalon Skillet and left super satisfied. My eggs were perfectly poached and everything was great!


I just had the Avalon Skillet and it was large, delicious and great value. The eggs were well cooked, and tasty. The homemade oat bread was delicious and I loved the strawberry compote thingy to go with it was nice. The potatoes were also nice and crispy. I will come back with friends and family.


My new favourite breakfast place. It‚Äôs a small greasy-spoon style diner, run by a family. The portions are large, the staff are amazingly friendly and the coffee is refillable. It was very busy the day we went and the staff/family was obviously struggling to keep up, but you could tell they were trying their best and everyone waited patiently. All around this place is amazing and I will go back many times.

Had a latt√© and a slice of orange cranberry pound cake. Latt√© was in a disappointingly small cup but tasted good. Cake was very stoggie like glue so def wouldn't reccomend. My friend had a muffin and it was stoggie too. It was impossible to have a private conversation even with music playing.

Staff were superb and very friendly. The coffee was nice and they were very nice about working around the combos for alternative choices. Only problem was the food, I am incredibly disappointed about the avocado bean burrito. I was unimpressed that the beans tasted like they came out of a Heinz beans can and the avocado wasn‚Äôt ripe, it was hard and had no taste as it wasn‚Äôt ready to be used yet. Very small as well
for almost $9, I would have went somewhere else for breakfast if I knew it was going to be like that..


As a proud resident of the Gorge neighbourhood, I am thrilled to see a coffee shop open up. My Americano was delicious and I look forward to trying everything else on the menu. I also saw that they have baby chairs, which is always a bonus as a parent.


Had the eggvacado bean burrito... the beans were from a can and the egg was very dry and the burrito for what you actually got was not worth the price in my opinion. If your in a pinch then this will suffice but if you have options go check out another eatery. The atmosphere is underwhelming and there is only two dining tables to actually eat at, the rest of the seating is couch style with coffee tables for eating.

A huge variety of latte choices including holiday season varieties. My favourite snack here is Bao Bun (glazed pork filling).


Cute little place with absolutely delicious Bao. So glad I found this place after moving to Victoria from Vancouver! The drink menu is extensive which is great for someone like me who can't have caffeine or dairy. Still lots of options for me! On this visit had their strawberry acai cooler which was great.

While the branding and furnishings are nice, it does feel more like a hole in the wall to get ones food to go rather than sit and eat. Though they do have a few tables it's a bit cramped and cluttered feeling. Maybe a slight redesign of the layout would help? Still, great spot for a breather while shopping, or to stop by and take something to the waterside. And the food more than makes up for the lack of ambience.


The honey glazed pork bao was simply amazing. I‚Äôm the best bao I‚Äôve ever had and definitely loves up to its reputation. Great value for the small price. Packed with pork, cucumber and cilantro. Lattes are delicious as well, will definitely be back!

Phenomenal cafe. Most delicious Korean lunch options available in the week. Excellent coffee/tea selection and Andrew the owner and the staff are the kindest. This is the cafe to visit while you are in the gorge area!


Tasty, but not worth the money. Paid $15 for the Tuesday special which is tasty but consists of nothing but white rice for the most part and a tiny piece of (very tasty) fish. For a work lunch, it is not worth the money. For less I can grab a diverse and tasty meal at other cafe's in the area.


Great and kind servings, and cozy and comfy atmosphere. The lady owner welcomed me and my wife for our first visit and gave a nice explanation of the menu. And the barista served awesome coffee, soup and Bibimbab which is one of Korean traditional meals.
Taste and service are all perfect!


Perhaps the most cheery staff of any coffee shop in Victoira. Very well extracted espresso, nice milk technique and just that little bit of effort put into an otherwise glass and metal cube to show that they care.

They offered to replace the yogurt with a bagel and then they told us they would charge us for it.


This little cafe is on the ground floor of the Parkside Hotel and Spa all suite hotel. They have a healthy line up of patrons waiting to order, and only four tables outside. We drove by one day and saw people holding their food and looking at the four little tables outside. I think they also have a couple of tables setup in the lobby of the hotel, plus the hotel lounge area, I'm sure Tre patrons can sit in the lobby as well. We had breakfast there. They experienced internet problems when it was my turn to order and pay, I had to pay cash. And fortunately, I had some cash with me instead of just relying on mobile pay. Cappuccino, latte, toast and jam. Although the bread was nice and chewy, they cut the slices so thin that it was almost like eating fresh melba toasts. The home made jam was too sweet for me. The picture of the cappuccino shows very wimpy foam ‚Äì yes, that's what it was.


We had a family vacation at the hotel and this was by far my favorite place.  Thank you James and crew for fabulous service, food and drinks on the Friday night.  The kids loved the hot chocolates in the morning and I enjoyed a few Chai Latte's. Definitely recommend a nice place to unwind at the end of the day, or get yourself going in the morning.


This was the location attached to our hotel, which gave a gift certificate for our stay.   We would have gone anyway.   Weather was beautiful and we could eat outside, creating a particularly nice ambience.  Happy hour meals were quite good, as were drinks.   Service was attentive.   We would return.


Wow!!! 5 Star Flavour at an incredibly affordable price - Did I say Wow?! Lol üòÇ A medley of comforting delight (Sweet Potato Gnocchi) but with a mysterious twist! Radish, Peas, Roasted Apple, and a Beautiful Homemade Cream Sauce! Arugula Garnish on the side - Tasteful and blended perfectly.

Loved it and would return. Ordered their calimari which had a great spice to it (was so good) and no unpleasant fishy taste! Highly recommend you try this. I also got the chicken strips and fries. The strips were good, the fries were great. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Great meal!


Had a lovely dinner. Staff were fantastic and the burger and salad were top shelf. Highly recommend stopping in.


Updated: I can no longer recommend breakfast. I don't know what happened. It used to be a great place for a classic breakfast. Now it's like some experimental kitchen serving unrecognizable dishes. I tried the French toast, a simple dish of bread, eggs, and milk, fried and served with butter and maple syrup. What arrived was thin slices of bread absolutely drowning in what I can only describe as thick orange goo of some sort, with a pile of bananas on top (a generous portion at least). It didn't resemble French toast in any way. A good example of ""improving"" on a simple idea until it becomes a disaster. I really should have photographed it because it was unbelievable. The flavours in this dish are supposed to be simple and delicious. Whatever this was ruined it.

By all means, come for lunch and dinner. The burgers are excellent, the steak pie is amazing, and the server is lovely. One of my favourites. You also can't believe the value. It's still one of the least expensive diners in town. But skip the breakfast as the chef seems bored with it and is trying to overcomplicate it.

Earlier review below:

Returned for dinner and enjoyed a wonderful steak and mushroom pot pie with a lovely flakey pastry crust. The service from Gurneet was friendly and welcoming.


The food was not good. Everything was incredibly bland. I had the salmon sandwich, and it was overcooked, dry, and underseasoned.  My wife had fish and chips that were incredibly underwhelming.  Fries had no seasoning at all. Food was just bad. Low quality ingredients and poorly executed.
My partner asked for a long island iced tea, and our server basically just said no because she didn't know how to make it. Ummm... that's what Google is for.  Look it up! Make it happen. Her response just blew my mind as I could see all the ingredients on the bar shelf. Our server did go off shift before our meals arrived, and the girl that took over was about the only highlight of our entire experience.  The second server was quite pleasant, but it didn't make up for the awful food.
Needless to say we will not be back and I would recommend you just keep driving. Skip this place.


Kid you not Victoria, if you haven't tried their BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger you're missing out! Make sure to go down and get it as it's way better hot and fresh, and cap it off with a $5.50 Blue Buck :)

Whatever they've changed over the past year is working! Way better than most places in town, and the pakoras are absolutely bang on too!

Food was really good. A nice place to stop by for lunch. We thought it was a drive through but there is actually parking and seating available. We had the eggs salad, chicken fingers, chicken burger and oyster burger. Oyster was my favorite and a definite must try. Oh the ice-cream was also certainly good.


My friend and I decided to go here for lunch.
We went inside as the line was short.
It was super busy and very loud.
When I picked up our food, I noticed that I got French fries instead of the onion rings I ordered .
I asked for them to be replaced.
Then, to make things easier, I said I would eat the fries.
The gentleman helping me said he would bring me onion rings.
I was truly disappointed as they were stuck together and way over fried.
I had to go back to get sauce for chicken fingers and was told I had to pay. Even though 1 pk is included.
He ended up bringing the sauce over, not knowing we had none.
Then it was time to get into my burger.
It wasn't even warm.
I took it  back and asked for my money to be refunded.
The same gentleman brought me my $ to the table.
I have been to this place so often and have had excellent burgers.
Today was a disaster.
On top of that, the same gentleman had to ask an employee to get up from one of the tables that is for paying guests.
The two older ladies actually apologized for asking her to move.
Wth?
What is the matter with this generation ?
I have yet to call the manager and put in a complaint.

I get that fast food places get busy.
It was one issue after the other today.
I'm completely disappointed with my visit today.


What a fantastic spot! Food comes up promptly and always so good! Ice cream of course is delicious too! Staff works very good together and makes the experience that much better. Very family friendly and good for any occasion.
Enough parking around and there‚Äôs also a bus stop next to it‚Äôs so accesible too (routes 2, 3, 5, 10)


We ordered a screaming hot burger, onion rings, and a turkey sadwich for $21.  A side of 3 pickle slices was $1.20. The onion rings felt like they were fried for two days. My burger had me screaming in regret. The sadwich made me sad. I was confused if this was how my order was supposed to be. If you're looking for the place that's got that juice, this ain't it. But they have some ice cream.

Great spot for breakfast & brunch! The outdoor seating is great, too. Our server, Jack, was super friendly, and the food and coffee were both perfect! It made our morning. They have options for vegans -  I had the avocado toast, minus the egg, and I got extra avo in lieu of the egg. I can‚Äôt wait to go back & try the Bircher oat bowl next time.


I feel the need to shout this from the roof tops!!! This was an excellent meal with excellent service. I can‚Äôt believe I spend as much time as I do in Victoria, with parents who live here and I didn‚Äôt know about Sherwood until today.

I met a friend here for coffee and was so happy to see that they offer coconut milk. The last of the plant based milks that are offered at coffee shops.

I took a peek at the dinner menu and talked my dad into trying it out for dinner (my last meal with him before I fly out).

First of all we had THE best waitress/server!!  Ally was bubbly, informative, and attentive. She knew the menu, made amazing suggestions and took the time to get to know us.

It‚Äôs suggested that the plates are for sharing so that‚Äôs exactly what we did.

Cauliflower steak, sardines, beetroot salad and mushroom calamari. Fresh, delicious, inventive and beautiful.

Cocktails were amazing as well. I had the humble bee and asked for it to be less sweet than normal. The bartender personally came over and made sure that I didn‚Äôt need anymore locally sourced honey. The 4 ingredients were all grown within 4km of the restaurant. Fabulous!!!

Victoria needs more creative, inspired restaurants like this one. I will be back for sure.


Was an absolute hidden gem for our first trip to Victoria. We were heading to a highly recommended place across the street that had a line for brunch, too long for us. Took a shot at Sherwood and am thankful now for that long line across the street. Would absolutely make this stop again the next time we‚Äôre back in Victoria.

Had a great latte and Salmon Breakfast Sandwich here (the sandwiches are pre-made, but they heated it up for me). The breakfast sandwich is made of buttery, savoury biscuits which are delicious. Took some cinnamon buns to-go: very tasty (almost as good as my mom's... but that's a high bar). Reasonable prices. Solid place - check it out if you're in the area.

*Note: Bubby's bun is the left one in the pic; I did a ""cinnabun-off"" against the Sally Bun, and I have a slight preference for Bubby's (although both were good).


I‚Äôve been here a dozen times with friends and it‚Äôs always enjoyable. They have amazing mochas and it‚Äôs what I usually get.

Great little place with indoor and outdoor seating. Good selection of vegan food for a light meal. Terrific coffee as well.  Say hi to Esteban as you walk in. I enjoyed the vegan chili w a gluten free bun.

Met a colleague for a business meeting here for my first visit last week.The staff are very kind and friendly. The atmosphere is totally not pretentious. Tables are quite small. Makes for a socializing but not the best for sitting down to discuss business, and probably not enough space if you like to work for hours at a coffee shop, plus there is no plug to charge your device. The girl who was working at the time was very nice and help full, she even offered me to charge my laptop behind the bar (in their working area). The other comment I have is the ordering area. t is a little awkward if you have not been before. But hey, it's about the coffee, food, quality of service and ambience and they all definitely score high with me. I would visit again.


First off I am sure the owner will jump in and reply to this negative review (see my post below for why) so I‚Äôm just going to be honest and upfront‚Ä¶
This was our first and last visit to Bubbys, we live right across from them in a condo and we are so disappointed in our visit.
They asked if we wanted our sandwiches toasted and our pizza reheated up..
Absolutely we did so we said yes, what happened next shocked us both‚Ä¶
they microwaved our sandwiches and pizza- yes microwaved the sannies with lettuce, tomatoes, onions etc inside.
ü§¢
And the pizza, well holy moly‚Ä¶
What happens when you use a microwave to heat up meat and veggies in a bun with sauce etc‚Ä¶
The pizza, well hello gooey and goopy dough, just inedible.
Absolute mush and disgusting, the staff didn‚Äôt seem to care and said the owner will most likely say something if we posted our review online.
We mentioned how this wasn‚Äôt what we were expecting and they didn‚Äôt know how to reply they just said this is what the owners wanted down.
We threw away our food after one bite each and decided to not go back to any of the locations
The services wasn‚Äôt great but the food was shameful and an embarrassment.
Save your money and go elsewhere, trust me on this one.

Also, there is a post about this company on Reddit, wow, I encourage everyone to look it up on that site, there are over a 100 people complaining about this business ever since it changed hands in 2018.
What a shame.


Great atmosphere and good food. Support local!


I always thought the food was good enough, not outstanding but overall tasty!

The management however is unprofessional and sketchy (not paying staff on time or the right amount for example).

Anyone complaining about the service don‚Äôt blame the students working there.

The chef will make you three different Benny's of their choosing and it's been super yummy every time! If you're feeling like a Cesar or Mimosa, Heron Rock has a fantastic list of all kinds of Cesar's to try as well as their ""Manmosa"".


Heron Rock Bistro is a really great place to dine in and enjoy a meal. My wife and I visited from the Edmonton area and we were very glad that we found this place.

What a lovely place with fantastic staff and great & tasty food. I had the freshly cooked mussels, they were amazing, afterwards the warm Reuben sandwich which I also enjoyed. The bread pudding was delicious.

My elderly dad and myself visited Victoria from Vancouver just before the long weekend of Thanksgiving. We were originally going to take one of those red double decker bus tours from The Empress Hotel but unfortunately & fortunately they were closed between Tuesday and Thursday so we decided to just get a day pass for regular BC transit buses and took the #2 bus to tour from DT to James Bay beach then back to DT and then eventually to Oak Bay beach area. As the result, we saved $70 for both (the red double decker bus is $80 for two) and we were able to find this cute corner bakery/coffee shop, ‚ÄúRuth & Dean‚Äù. It totally looks just like a country side rustic coffee shop which I like personally, and we decided to grab some drink and sit outside table on the side walk under the beautiful old huge oak tree. And I had chai latte with almond milk (lactose intolerant üòµ‚Äçüí´ü•õ) and it was delish! Their baking goods looked also so good but unfortunately we were already full with lunch earlier so we saved for the next time. Their beautiful cake looked so good, the ladies ahead of me ordered a big slice of it and she said it‚Äôs very good! And I believe her. üòÇ The place is very spacious, nice outdoor tables and nice cozy and peaceful atmosphere all around that area. I recommend anyone who likes to have a little get away, find this little cute community with some other shops and restaurants. The gorgeous clean beach is just a few blocks down on Estevan St. It was such a nice treat for both my dad and myself to relax and refresh ourselves from living in the heart of Vancouver DT.


We quickly googled a spot to stop for lunch while we were out biking & just the vibe in the pictures made me want to check out this gem of a place! And we were so happy we found Ruth & Dean‚Äôs! We had the BLT with salad, corn chowder, the oat & fudge bar & a mocha. üëå Deeeeelish!

Dinner in the bar was great with friendly conversation, and they accommodated us when we said we needed our breakfast to be quick. Great location to visit the stunning Beacon Hill Park.

One of the best breakfasts for the best price I've had in years.  And all of the eggs Benny's were phenomenal. Also, the various servers each of the 3 times I was there were absolutely fantastic. Can't wait to go back.


This is the second time I've stayed here. I love it, the rooms are small and still use the old style hot water heating radiator so if it's cold in there it will take a bit to heat up. There is no AC so I'd expect it can get hot in the summer. The hotel has a colourful history and is over 100 years old. The hallways are adorned with Emily Carr Paintings (she died there) also the hotel supposedly is one of the most haunted in Canada although I haven't experienced anything while there.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you're into older style hotels that aren't just another boring place then this place is for you.


This is one of my favorite spots for dinner when in town.  I‚Äôve tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something I didn‚Äôt enjoy.

In addition to the regular menu, they have specials each evening, which typically include a pasta and a main entree.  These can sell out quickly on busy nights.

The Caesar salad is amazing and I always get one!

There are several vegetarian options and the veggie burger is great.

Bar options are limited in the restaurant but you can enjoy beer or wine with your meal.

Overall, this is a cozy place to check out for great vegan eats. Price is reasonable, generous portions and large selection of vegan items. They also had festive drinks üéÑ


Fern consistently delivers 10/10 for friendliness, cleanliness, food variety, punctuality, and flavour. I have NEVER been disappointed in anything I've ordered. Within my first couple visits years ago, they remembered my name - which is so homey, and definitely adds to the experience!
It's always difficult to decide what to order - so my husband and I always choose 2 separate hot meals (so we can taste both), and 2-4 pastries üòÅ
The portions are HUGE, and easily 2 meals - so the pastries (also huge) are always saved for later.
I usually bring my stroller inside while dining in, and the seating has ample room to accommodate, so we don't have to go sit outside or in the car to enjoy a hot meal.
A friend of mine is gluten free, and said she's had no problem with Fern substituting items in order to accommodate her preferences.
My omnivore friends don't believe me when I tell them that yes, everything you're eating is definitely 100% vegan.
Thanks so much for always being a welcoming environment, and for such delicious food! It's so lovely to go somewhere and know without a doubt you're not accidentally being served non-vegan food.
Thank you!!


Decided to give this place a try looking at the reviews and turned out the reviews were 100% accurate.
My customer service experience here was top notch! The staff were friendly and helpful hosts!
My order was ready pretty quick despite how busy they were.
The ""chickun"" was crispy on the outside and juicy inside! If I could make vegan food this good I would turn vegan instantly!!!
The pancakes were light and super fluffy! I also ordered a mocha with oat milk which tasted delicious!! Looking forward to next time!!


So. Freaking. Good. I stopped by  for lunch with a girlfriend of mine who is a regular and did not leave disappointed! As someone who doesn‚Äôt eat meat for moral reasons, one of the things I missed most was a good chicken sandwich, and man I found it. I think this may sway my non-vegan hubby as well (slowly but surely!)

The texture bang on and flavour was delicious. I had a side of Caesar salad, which was crunchy and tasty as well. Not to mention the brownie and latte for desert, drool.

The owner clearly takes such pride in creating and serving delicious, ethical food options and considering the price of good ingredients, and portion size it‚Äôs good value.

I will be back soon, and can‚Äôt wait to try more of the menu.


When I first moved here to Vic I think every single person recommended me to check out Fern! I haven‚Äôt been back since they opened their indoor dining but their take-away service at their window was super efficient and covid-friendly! I appreciate all the creativity they bring to vegan options!!

First time dining here this weekend and was very pleasantly surprised it lived up to the hype! Best french onion soup I've ever had and escargot was fantastic. Will definitely be back!


1. chicken supreme
- so good! soft n tender, mushroom sauce and cabbage was right on the point 10/10!
2. lobster bisque
- amazingly good and i love the texture, could be more salty and richer though
3. french fries
- hot and crispy just perfecto

in general: very good service, there was a bit of waiting for the food but that‚Äôs fine, dinners good!

Everything has been incredible, the attention of the staff and the food.  I recommend you share the menus, since they are very abundant.  I recommend this restaurant.


Worse restaurant food ever. Very lukewarm service.  Pictures say a thousand words. The carrots were charred black and inedible, the duck leg was black and there‚Äôs a rat, named Remi, that makes better Ratatouille.  Believe it or not, we had to pay for this.  Very, very sad that we didn‚Äôt go to our favourite, Brasserie l‚Äôecole.

Service was excellent, room is very cozy and a nice amount of space between tables - really lovely renovations. The food is interesting yet approachable and you can tell the chef has really taken the time to created an elevated menu. My only ‚Äòdislikes‚Äô are personal preferences so I won‚Äôt get into them, however a couple dishes were a little busy and some of the fried items could have come a little crispier. Overall a great night, will definitely be back to try more dishes & drinks. A much needed addition to Victoria‚Äôs restaurant scene.


What an excellent find! We grabbed a table at 12:25pm on a Father‚Äôs Day Sunday, needing to be back across the street at the ferry terminal by 1:30pm for immigration/customs, and the kind folks at Fathom did an excellent job. I got a Caesar beverage ‚Äî good and spicy ‚Äî and we got a chorizo and bacon hash, chicken sandwich, and a classic eggs Benedict. All were served with flavorful home fries, and they were all really delicious; the portions were generous and the hollandaise was on point. I particularly liked the great spice level of the hash. The decor was elegant and classy without being fussy. It was the perfect Father‚Äôs Day brunch!


We stayed at the Grand Pacific so it was nice to just go downstairs and grab HH. Glad we check the restaurant out. We enjoyed the modern cozy atmosphere, warm welcome, and delicious drinks made by Chad. He is a character! We enjoy his company and drink a lot! His negroni version is phenomenal!
We had a couple of bites and it was pretty delicious!
Going to dinner here next time we are back in town!


We enjoyed our dinner at Fathom! The atmosphere, service, and food quality are absolutely 5 stars.
Thank you Francina for having us at the beautiful and comfortable window seats and Donna for helping us select our food and drinks to pair with.
Can't wait for the next time! :)


My husband and I have discovered this place through dine around Victoria this year, and we took our whole family to restaurant for mother‚Äôs day dinner this time. Food was delightful and atmosphere was comforting. The waiter was very professional and friendly. Their Arcadian salad with prawn and spicy tuna bites were absolutely 5 star starters and spaghetti vongole, steak and wagyu burger were really delicious, but scallop risotto was bit salty (Still good though). Overall, we had a great dinner and we will definitely be coming back.

The patio was such an amazing, peaceful and chill vibe. The food was incredible. We ordered the Mexican Corn, Halibut & Chips, and French Onion Soup. Everything was very well prepared and blew us away! For dessert, we tried the French Vanilla Creme Brulee which was absolutely incredible. The servers were very kind and ensured we were taken care of. We will definitely come back and dine here again.


10 acres delivers! the food is delicious, looks great and all from their own farm.
Make sure to make a reservation so you get a great table.
We had the chicken and mussels,  I feel it was a mistake. Should have stuck with one theme. Either seafood. Or no seafood.
The chicken was very very good.
I‚Äôd have it again.


Great location. Cocktails are not worth it although they sound really good on the menu. Service was a miss. Took us about 30 minutes from being seated until we got our orders in and took a bite. Quite loud if seated indoors. Seafood charcuterie was bomb! We were starving and this was THE fix. Humboldt squid appetizer was also very good. Worth trying.


The cocktails are great!! And the fresh onions soup has cheese on it bread in it. The lamb is the best I've ever eatenÔºåvery soft and juicyÔºÅDelicious oysters and pastaÔºÅ Black forest Chocolate cake also üëç


What an awesome place to hang out and eat good food. The exterior and interior screams chic and posh but the service and the warmth by the staff are anything but. It instantly feels welcoming and inclusive and the servers were so approachable as well. Got the set dinner and went with whatever the server recommended and legit, following their advice was the best choice I ever made after saying no to hardcore drugs.

Good intimate vibes, quiet enough to chat, enough white noise to fill out awkward silences and awkward moaning over food, and the service is quick and friendly. Would take all my significant others to this place because the servers seem sharp enough to pretend they don‚Äôt know about my other significant others. (It‚Äôs a joke I‚Äôm joking but not about the food it‚Äôs really good)

Plus, the view... We love the dome, it's much quieter and private. Last time we had the kids with us and we were so at ease there as we knew we were not bothering anyone and our toddler wouldn't just runaway. We ate at peace. It is not just good food, it's a dining experience that all couples and young families should have.


Let‚Äôs start with the positive. View is extraordinary, you get to see the inner harbour from a very good angle. Staff are friendly and helpful. Now the terrifying part is the food which is a hit and miss. Chicken wings were amazing. Burger, sandwich, and fish and chips were horrifying. It‚Äôs hard to screw up fish and chips on the island. So many other places do it so well. The batter was very thick AND soft. Thick batter we have seen, but soft thick uncooked batter is weird. As for the the burger and sandwiches, bacon was very hard, patty all you taste is salt, and the buns were quite burned. Fries, some were not folly cooked. Manager was quick to address our experience. People here are nice, but I don‚Äôt know if I would risk the chance for the food though.


Overlooking the harbor, this restaurant offers a stunning view that captivates. Too bad the rest wasn't the same. While the service was fine but not great, the food falls short of inspiration or taste.  Nonetheless, the picturesque location may still appeal to those seeking a scenic dining experience with average culinary offerings.


I took my mother and grandma here for dinner. It was wonderful to sit in one of the domes out side and have our own private space. The heater made it so cozy and we appreciated that there are blankets if we need. The food and drinks were amazing and the server was lovely. Our only complaint is after they served us coffee and a drink after dinner, the server  completely dissapeared. It would have been nice to have another round of drinks/ coffee but, we waited over 20 minutes AFTER finishing our drinks before giving up and going in to pay. At a nice establishment like this, I expect service right to the very end.


This place was great. Nice big restaurant area. Staff were great!
Really good quality food and nice drink. We actually laughed at another review about this place because it must have been an off night. Everything was great, big wine list too.

Wow, simply the best food and experience.  Of course the views and vibes at the restaurant are what you expect‚Ä¶ sitting there makes you appreciate why Victoria is loved.  Service was friendly and welcoming.  Food was on another level, and the wine pairings were thoughtful and enjoyed. There is so much care, technique and experience put into the food.  With that in mind, I think the prices are on the low side.  Everywhere has increased their prices because of current issues surrounding operating restaurants in 2022 - so I feel you get quite a lot of value for their current pricing. It‚Äôs appreciated but understand if prices need to be adjusted.


It was such a peaceful experience eating with a sea view. We had brunch, which was chicken with waffles and eggs. The flavour in all the dishes was unreal, especially the soft texture of the waffles. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but the staff was super nice and still gave us a view table. Couldn‚Äôt be any better. Big shoutout to Kaitlyn I believe, she was so friendly from saying hi to bye. She told us about the dishes and about places we could visit in Victoria while we were there. Overall, great staff and amazing food. On a side note, patio was closed when we visited so if you‚Äôre going to have a patio experience, just call the restaurant and confirm.


Spent a lovely night with good friends/fellow chefs thanks to the aura for supplying a amazing dining experience. The food was some best I've ever had in my life. Especially the tuna and the pork belly. Muah üëå. The plates are were all small and shared between two people yet by the end I was stuffed despite a big appetite. To conclude, for the price of only 65$ per person and eating such delectable food till a full belly I'd definitely recommend either this menu or single plates off it.


Would definitely give the overall High Tea experience at Aura a high score. The service was on point, the presentation beautiful, and the views are some of the best in the city. I also really loved the Japanese twist on most of the bites - starting with salmon aburi on an onikamiyaki pancake & a chicken katsu sandwich, ending with sesame tarts, matcha opera cake and more. But I did find myself wishing that all flavours were kicked up about two notches. Standouts we‚Äôre the glazed scone and katsu sandwich. Could live withouts include the pork bun, tamago sandwich and beets on a bun.


Great Western omelette and Aura Benedict! We enjoyed our stay in the hotel as well as our breakfast at Aura waterfront restaurant. We were also with 3 toddlers and they were kept busy with the provided drawing supplies which was nice.

However, food wise we only liked the Korean cauliflower per the suggestion from the waitress. My green salad was missing tomatoes and had almost no pumpkin seeds and cranberries. Felt very cheap. My friend power bowl had no sauce, and so little quinoa. Again not impressed and we were disappointed. Sangria were good. I‚Äôm willing to come back but I might stick to burgers.


A friend took me to McRae's for the first time and I was a little disappointed with the food I received. Granted, the restaurant was quaint. To start, my friend and I shared the hummus that was in the 'share plates' section and it was delicious. The naan bread/pita tasted super good with the hummus and the carrots was crispy and fresh. We weren't super hungry so we got a grilled cheese and the mac and cheese off of the happy hour menu. Can't go wrong with the grilled cheese, nice and crispy. The mac and cheese on the other hand, it was really disappointing. The cheese sauce they used made the whole thing super unappetizing, also the cold cheese and breadcrumbs on top just made it worse. Also it was lukewarm, it did not taste fresh at all. The service was alright, there was a lack of eye contact super mediocre.


Good veggie burger, great kids mac n cheese, tasty pulled pork sandwich. Nice service. It looks nice for having drinks with friends


Found this place via a Google recommendation. Love the cozy atmosphere and speedy service. I had the Salmon burger and it tasted so fresh and cozy. The bun and sauces added to this very satisfying flavour that I haven't tasted in a burger before. Furthermore, the onion rings were incredibly crunchy. Great meal. I'd personally recommend.


-good nachos, not a huge serving
-blue moon wings were great, came with carrots and dip
-sat outside on the patio with the heater

The food was fresh, prepared well, and tasted, well, like food should taste. It wasn't greasy, overly seasoned or overly salted.

Service was professional but friendly and the atmosphere was wonderful. The restaurant was clean and the Christmas decorations were very tastefully done.

I ordered the tater bowl which was very good. It wasn't oily and felt ""clean"". The fully loaded oatmeal was fruity and had a good mix of flavors from the berries, banana and brown sugar, cream for the oats. My partner had the French toast which she really enjoyed. The granola, we were curious what a 14 dollar granola tasted like, it was just granola with fruits. It was good, but not with the money. There were better options to be had.

Overall, I loved breakfast and look forward to returning again.


Atmosphere is very nice and high end. Service was very good, waiter was very on top of water and refills for our drinks.
I had the Lamb and without a doubt this was the best lamb I have ever had. The crust was made to perfection, very crisp but not burnt and season very well. The lamb flavor was present but not over barring. When I took a bit of the lamb, this was one of the few times I had to pause and close my eyes to full immerse myself in what I was eating. I would 100% recommend the lamb.


We‚Äôve been to Q a couple of times now. The first was summertime and enjoyed an outdoor dinner that overlooked the harbour. All the food was fantastic and the drinks were well crafted. Our second time we enjoyed sitting in their lounge and enjoyed late night pizza, complimentary popcorn, and some incredible desserts. The ambiance was lovely and we had excellent service from our waiter. A highly recommended experience if you‚Äôre willing to spend the money on it.


Received a gift certificate and used it with my partner. Server was polite enough and very professional as there definitely is an image to be held there I guess. It got busier around 6pm. Food was good, but we were able to splurge as the gift certificate was an appetizer, entree, and dessert per person with no maximum. The entrees are pricey.. $40 for a chicken dish ! But they are quality ingredients and you're also dining in a touristy spot of the city (we were asked where we were visiting from by the server for small talk). The other customers were dressed very casual to.


First time visit at the Fairmont Empress.
Went in for a lunch to celebrate a friend's birthday.
Kind of disappointed with the food offering, but that is compensated with the ambience and the live music.
Their Roasted tomato soup was really great.
And the Pizza dough they use is very healthy and tasty.
You have to have their rich chocolate cake if you are ever eating here, it was amazing.

From classic cocktails, the best fancy corn dog and one of the most unique cocktails I have ever had, the Mind Hive. Happy hour runs from 2 to 5.

Loved The Cortney Room.


I have been the The Courtney Room for brunch, happy hour, and dinner, and I have never been disappointed.

The food is fantastic, and they have numerous gluten free options if you require gluten free (even a separate fryer). A piece of advice - you MUST get the potatoes courtney - they are literally out of this world.

They have a fully stocked bar and can make you just about any drink, and they have a cocktail list that features unique drinks which regularly changes.

I would highly recommend The Courtney room for a special occasion dinner, happy hour drinks with friends, or a nice weekend brunch.


Underwhelmed. We went for Mother‚Äôs Day brunch and it was really nothing special. Their cappuccino was velvety and delicious, but everything else was a bit of disappointment. I had heard some many good things about their brunch over the years but I didn‚Äôt live up to my expectations, unfortunately. They do, however have great, fresh oysters for dinner.


The first time I went there, so the review is based off of one time. The food is alright nothing special, the chicken and waffles was room temperature at best. The Shakshuka was better for sure and worth a try. The service was not good, we had to keep trying to get their attention and barely had them check up on us.

There‚Äôs not a lot open late in Victoria so this is a good option for a decent selection. The rare steak was very good, the truffle fries were really good. The rest was just OK.

The new truffle ravioli was disappointing and I got it with the prawns but they were pathetically small and underwhelming (not worth the extra $). The ravioli was good but felt a bit undercooked, the sauce was a bit watery and didn‚Äôt adhere to the pasta well.

The Cajun chicken was tasty and not dry, the ribs were a little dry. It came with potato salad which was kind of bland.

The atmosphere in here is nice and decent service! Good location, but if you‚Äôre driving since it‚Äôs downtown you need to take a bit of time to park.


I visited Victoria Canada on 6.30.2022 not only was the city breath taking the food at Earls was phenomenal! Our waiter was attentive and he was on top of our meal. It was delivered hot and he was such a nice person. I ordered the impossible burger and yam fries as my meal and they taste delicious. The appetizers were salt and pepper and BBQ wings everything was great tasting. I will return üòã.


After a tiresome day travelling, my partner arranged dinner for me. Given the quality of airport food (you already know), I was absolutely starved when I got home.

What a blessing this food was. From perfectly braised BBQ ribs, to potatoes with bacon bits and sour cream, to a fresh slaw, every bite was pure heaven. So much for trying to be vegetarian again ü•µüòÇ (joking of course, ish). The birthday cake was just as delicious. It was my first time trying those additions that came with the cake, but they really provided a nice texture and satisfying taste. Will 100% be returning !


Giving Earles 3 stars. First the positives. Decor was nice and the restaurant was clean. Also very friendly staff from hostess to our waitress.  Food came out promptly and visually very appetizing. My wife ordered the tuna poke bowl and she said she liked it. Unfortunately I can't say the same for my dinner. I ordered the Nashville chicken sandwich which was supposed to be spicy however it was anything but.  I understand it's supposed to be deep fried chicken but where's the chicken? And what was there I couldn't really taste because the batter was so heavy, dried up, and cold.  Needles to say if you are going to Earles avoid the Nashville chicken sandwich.


we did not book a table, but on Saturday evening they found a free place for us. Very attentive waiters. We ordered spring rolls, spinach - very tasty, beautiful serving of the dish. The only downside to this place is that the music is very loud....

Highlights:
Great service
Atmosphere
Location
Saw a number of group tables which looked happy
Wheelchair accessible (looked like it to me, which is nice)

Extra things to consider:
Parking

My experiences won't really stop me from coming back. We have family dinners for peoples birthdays and we manage to rotate as best as we could around restaurants in Victoria, so I'm sure someone will choose this place as a venue again.

Overall, family members (party of 9) mostly were pleased with their meal. All of us was happy with the service. We didn't feel forgotten, or felt like we were inconveniencing them.  Atmosphere is always consistent and warm when you walk in. The outdoor patio looks comfortable.

My only complaint is the food... never seems to be enough in fries (ok sorry, I guess potatoes are going up in price). My husband ordered the strips and fries (strips are always good, with the honey mustard), but the fries portion keeps seemingly getting smaller every year we come back. My pizza was good, but just good; seemed more like a fancy flat bread. It felt like it was alright, but felt like something was missing. The Artichoke dip was flavourful, no complaints there- nicely cheesy, had good consistency, didn't feel like we were really saving on portions so much.

Since the place does get busy, it's good to maybe note that parking could get tricky. We had to park a little further down at the residential street.

Again, maybe I'm just nit-picking, but I'll probably be back. I will just say the service is always good.


Absolute delicious food, they never disappoint! The place is lively and always has something going on. I have been here for trivia and music bingo and it was loads of fun! The bartenders are absolutely delightful and super knowledgeable! They also have a lovely fireplace.


Very much looking forward to coming here again. The atmosphere and decor were stellar. I had the 1/4 chicken and rib dinner and everything was delectable, including the coleslaw which usually never finds its way off the plate. The gravy was out of this world and everything on the menu was very reasonably priced.


Round two & Redemption (from August 2022): We thought we would give this place another shot and glad we did! The food was spectacular and service was on point!!

From 6 months ago (January 2022): The great venue and atmosphere was enhanced by the fantastic service and food!!! The wait- staff were amazing! So much so that we came back the next night after a long evening's work (6 hours) at exactly the same time, but sadly to find out the kitchen staff decided to shut down early to have a few pops. The night before was fantastic, the next night... not so much.


The lady who served me was absolutely wonderful! Check back in often, made sure I was comfortable and had my food served in a timely manner. Very well done, will be back again

In my reservation I had requested a table overlooking the Inner Harbour if possible, for the special occasion. Upon arrival we were taken to the other side of the restaurant and seated with a less than desirable view of some buildings below. It was slightly busy, but noticed some empty tables as we walked in, so I inquired about a better table as per my online request. Though not a ‚Äòwindow‚Äô seat, our server was able to seat us at an empty elevated booth near the Harbour side of the restaurant, across the aisle from the windows, giving us a view of the ocean! My granola parfait was oddly mostly pineapple chunks, which I left as I dislike them; however, my breakfast potatoes were very good, and my friend enjoyed his benny. Our banana smoothies were also very delicious! Overall, it was a nice breakfast, reasonably priced, and our server was very nice! Would pass on the parfait for next time.

*Note: the empty tables pictured were mostly all occupied when we arrived*


The food here is simply amazing. Wife and I loved the food and the amazing views and service. It is one of the places that you promise yourself to come back for more. All aspects from drinks to dessert all top notch. We waited in hotel lobby after a long walk to refresh with some chilled lemon water before heading up. There is a Lego model of hotel in lobby which you have to see.


Overall upset about the service. Firstly, despite requesting window seats since booking close to 2 weeks in advance, they could only give us a booth across a walking aisle because the host said they were booked upon arrival. Throughout the meal until the end, I walked around the restaurant for the different views and for the bathroom and no one ever sat at those questionable ""booked"" tables. The view wasn't spectacular either way. The food was not bad as the flavor was on point and portions were as described. However, my $40 steak had over 25% worth of inedible membrane in it and I voiced my disappointment to the server. He was very polite but couldn't offer any good explanation. He mentioned he could get a discount on the bill but never got back to us until I question the bill at the end. Wish they could just offer a small percentage discount or even a small complimentary dessert. That could easily win a five-star. Small offerings to satisfy an upset customer goes a long way. I have been to many similar-level restaurants that could do much better. Quite a bit of improvement in management is needed, including seat allocation.


A convenient downtown Victoria location, with a fantastic 270 degree wrap around view of the inner harbour. The food was excellent and the service staff were professional and very friendly. Made for a memorable dinner with friends.


We went in for me and my friends 18th birthday. Amelia was fun, helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu. She did a great job creating a laid back lovely experience. Food was fantastic, views absolutely worth it. Will be back the next time we are in the province!

My partner and I went to Saveur during Taste of Victoria. We are both adventurous eaters, and we like a wide variety of tastes.  Our dinner was probably one of my least favourite meals that I‚Äôve ever had - it was genuinely not good (in addition to being very expensive, but we knew that in advance). For Taste of Victoria, there was a set menu so I ordered one appetizer and entree, and my partner ordered the other choices. We did not enjoy any dish. The highlight of our meal was the pickled radish that was on the side of Skate dish, which speaks to the quality of the rest of the food. The service was fine. We were really excited to try here after seeing the amazing reviews but it was a very disappointing experience.


Absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. It‚Äôs the sort of meals that brings you to wonder‚Ä¶ how did they manage to turn mundane ingredients, you find in any fridge, into something so delicious!?

The setting is clean and nicely decorated, the seatings were well sectioned for covid as well. I think they did try their best to serve but they were a little bit understaffed.

Would love to try more dishes next time in Victoria!


Worth the splurge!!!  Yes it's expensive. And yes it was amazing! Good things are worth spending money on and if you've never had a fine dining meal, this should be on your local list to try! Service was attentive and on point. The meals were paired wonderfully with reds and whites appropriately. We started off with a super fun creative chai inspired whiskey sour! If James has it available, order it!!! When they say their tenderloin is like butter, it's true. And yes, you should pair wine with your dessert!
It's a small venue, with small tables but the service keeps on top of your table helping to avoid clutter. Thanks Chef, James, and Ryan for the great time!


Nice french restaurant with an Asian twist. The food is all very pretty and the service is great (prob cuz they add an 18% service charge regardless of the no. of people in your group).

The food is on the pricier end but it's is pretty good. I especially liked the pork belly.


Great food and wonderful service! The flavours were delicate and well balanced, yet super flavourful and unique. The presentation was beautiful. The service was great; We took our time and didn't feel rushed.

The one thing is, it wasn‚Äôt busy or anything but I felt the service was very slow. Took a long time for them to come around to us. But the food is great ! The patio portion is heated and enclosed which is cool.


The customer service in the restaurant was good, our servers were friendly and welcoming. All of the items we ordered were delicious. I was a little busy inside the restaurant, but a majority of the restaurants around this area are and it was definitely worth the wait. Would definitely come again!


Browns is always a nice place to go for lunch. My mom enjoys their veggie burgers and I enjoy their selection of drinks. The service at Browns is always good and staff is always friendly. I decided to try their new brunch options and was a little disappointed however they are new and they might need time to perfect brunch.


There are a few Browns in town, we went to the one downtown which has good location, staff are friendly, allow reservation and more importantly it is not too busy as the one uptown.  Highly recommend.


Went looking for a place to have brunch. Had immediate seating which was a bonus on a Sunday morning in Victoria. Food was good and plentiful, but the potatoes were undercooked. Server was very nice and attentive.

My favorite was bloody merry with pineapple, shrimp, mozzarella and kabanos. We had a quick lunch while exploring city during our cruise stop at Victoria. Lovely island with lovely parks and scenery.
I took mushroom soup which was too bland for me but spinach artichoke dip and my husbands tacos were excellent. Price was very good as well.  Service was very quick.


Restaurant looked super busy but was able to be sat in less than 5 minutes. Fast service and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.

Fish Tacos with Fries, Sweet & Fire Cauliflower, Margarita, Peach Bellini were all delicious.

Food was fresh and drinks were strong!  Plenty of outdoor seating. Family friendly, close to the water. Highly recommend if your in the area.


Enjoyed Happy Hour at Milestones Grill + Bar on the famed Victoria Harbour. Fortunate to get an outdoor table on a beautiful summer day. The food and service were excellent and thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos and bloody Mary's. The location is also hard to beat with all the energy of harbour life including sailboats, water taxis, seaplanes, cruise ships, power boats, tourists and sidewalk vendors. Well worth checking it out!


We enjoyed Happy Hour at Milestones on the Wharf. The scenery, food and drinks are always outstanding.

Delicious food, and excellent staff. We went to Victoria for our 14th anniversary, and chose Milestones for a romantic dinner. The atmosphere wasn't as romantic as we had hoped, but the other diners seated around us seemed like they were having a wonderful time, and it really helped boost our mood. We liked it so much, we went back the next day for brunch while we waited for the ferry.

The food was delicious, the decor and atmosphere quirky and fun. We only found this place through Groupon and we were glad we did. The curry poutine was unique.


Poutine tots with cheese curds, hollandaise sauce and pulled pork was pretty dang tasty!  Friendly service and quiet... winning combo for breakfast.  Don't forget range free poached eggs too

We really had an amazing experience here. Food is great at amazingly low prices. From entrance to exit all are super organized, really appreciate. Would love to come again. I visited for breakfast and lunch as well on different days, it was fun !! Never expected food to be that good.


To my Mom and I went for a lovely lunch.  We had a lovely server Pilar.

I had breakfast there a couple of days ago while visiting visiting Victoria. Both the food and service (so professional!) were very good. Prices were extremely reasonable - excellent value!  I wish there were more places like that. It‚Äôs nice to sit at a table with proper tablecloth and special tableware designed specially for them. It was a lovely experience.


As always, today, July 21st, 2022, the experience, the menu selection, the service, not to mention our blueberry pie dessert which we shared,was amazingly good!

Server was wonderful, as we waited for our party to arrive and as we celebrated a birthday. Food and environment was great, and they allowed us to store the cake in their fridge. Server sang happy birthday and provided a lit candle and large knife to cut the cake.


Went with my fiancee and a friend a few weeks ago. Definitely a nice neighborhood pub- currently nice for outdoor seating, and seems to be OK with the dogs outdoors. The speed of service was good, we didn't have to wait longer than about 8-10 minutes until our order was taken, and it looked like a busy night. The food was brought out in a timely manner as well, nothing was missing, food was hot. I has the fish burger with avocado. Unfortunately the avocado didn't do so much for me but it was good nonetheless. I would definitely come back to try more menu items, as they looked really good as well.


Great place for a meal with friends and family.  They are all really kind even with some of our table's specific orders they can accommodate almost anything.

I would recommend the chicken strips. Burgers are also really good. Juicy and full of flavors.

I would recommend getting a reservation if you plan on going in the evenings. They can have longer wait times if you show up at the door.

There is also parking to the side of the building, not too many spots though.


Stop here everytime I'm in the area and love it. Great food with good service and friendly staff

The staff were friendly and very attentive, and we were seated, ordered and served lunch faster than expected. Especially as it was busier than expected. The menu is a good size, without endless options. So many dishes looked good enough to invite return visits. We sat out on the covered patio, under space heaters that made me feel like bread in a toaster. Thankfully the server lowered it for us. I had the Cowboy salad, and while plentiful and tasty, my sole complaint was the dressing was too light. The rougher wooden tabletops aren't smooth, and there was long blind hair stuck in ours. Must be very hard to keep clean. Then the closet size washroom was claustrophobic, and washing my hands made the air dryer sensor trigger and blow the water everywhere. Whoever designed this didn't try using it too. Not a big deal tho, I'd go back.


Sooooooo,  it was not busy and inside was nice.  Our server gave us our drinks and we waited at least over 30 min for our meal.  I ordered the spicy crispy chicken and my wife got the turkey dip.  My burger wasn't really hot nor spicy and my wife's meal was dry and rough to eat.  We saw our server soon as we got our meals and did not even offer us water or a refill in our drinks,  she even walked by us at least 5 times with a empty glass and did not even talk to us.  My meal was okay, our server was not good at all, and the prices were too high.


Great bartenders, good selection of beer. Didn‚Äôt eat much but the food I‚Äôve seen be brought out looks good. Came here to watch some hockey games and was pleasantly surprised.


Absolutely my fave pub restaurant in the city of Victoria & in West Vic/Esquimalt.  How they consistently not only hit the mark every time but somehow get better each time I eat the same thing over & over, I‚Äôm really not sure, but the WOW factor is there. Super friendly and professional service, awesome bar/mixologist, food yum, hot, crispy, oozing delightful goodness over & over again! As always, my burger, the BBQ Bacon cheese burger, amazing, the Parm fries, crisp, just enough parm, garlic aioli & the deep fried mac 'n cheese balls with an amazing marina sauce with a full on 'the real deal' cold vodka with olives martini......They get it! Service, taste, presentation & vibe! Bravo Brown's Crafthouse Vic West on Wilson Dt, just over the bridge from dt Vic. You are the best! This was my farewell martini burger dinner as I am moving to The Okanagan next week, but might have to pop in for just one more before I go. And that martini! A simple thing really but rarely does one get it as right as tonight! Thank you! xBüç∏üçî‚úåÔ∏è


My boyfriend's buddy Matt recommended this place for its French Dip (stated it was so good that even his dad, the pickiest food critic he knows, liked it). My boyfriend is sold on the French Dip, saying it is the best tasting beef dip he ever tasted. I'm more interested in trying out other entree choices such as the crispy chicken ramen. Next visit I'll try the salads as they seem interesting but too full for this time around.

Friendly and knowledgeable staff, always welcoming and give lots of thoughts in preparing the food. Best part - their coffee and pastries. I love the dark chocolate pistachio cookies and the dark chocolate banana bread. come here every week we are in downtown


Can‚Äôt say enough good about Tractor. No waitresses + order at the counter = faster service and affordable prices. Food quality is superb. Nutritious. Open flame grill. Mellow. Authenticity. Fair and good business. Menu does not force me to get a big combo plate. Proteins, salads and soups each bought on own.


Can't fault a thing! The food was just flavour packed, healthy, sustainable and I thought pricing was fair for the value. Their self serve cutlery station and water tap allowed us to social distance safely while dining out. The curry sandwich was a great portion size and truly authentic. Their blueberry parfait had great textures and flavours while being very healthy to eat. And their compostable food containers made me feel ethical about my dining decision. Way to go guys!


Exactly what we needed! Tasty, healthy, fulfilling food at a good price plus the location is perfect! I love that they have so many gluten free and vegetarian options that are not necessarily a salad, but full meals. We ordered a cup of lentil soup, chicken sandwich, Thai bowl with tofu and chocolate / pistachio cookies. The staff was really friendly


If your looking for a great healthy place to eat in Victoria this is the place!  They also have several Vegan options available!

We tried the Chicken Avocado Sandwich which was served on a Ciabatta Roll. We also tried the Nourish Bowl which comes with Power Greens & Brown Rice. You get the option to add two Market Sides to it. We chose the Edamame Crunch & Lemon Kale.

Everything was great. Plenty of indoor seating, also a great outdoor area as well that looks towards the harbor.

Very friendly service and crepe was delicious! Ordered the vegetarian crepe with portobello mushroom, goat cheese and brie. Drink was a long espresso with whipped cream.

Can foresee outdoor seating being comfortable but indoor seating seemed a little temporarily built.


Best restaurant in Victoria, to be honest. (Although I haven‚Äôt visited their dinner restaurant yet.)

I go here almost every week, so I decided I should finally make a review.

The heart of this place is the delicious selection of CR√äPES. I especially love the savoury crepes. They‚Äôre filled with different kinds of melted cheeses, with protein (bacon, fried eggs, ham, smoked salmon, scallops, prawns, etc.) on top, and often a sauce of some kind as well.

My favourites are the Lorraine (bacon and eggs on top with cream cheese inside), the saumon fum√© (cream cheese inside with smoked salmon, lemon, and truffle oil on top), and the mira-mar (Swiss cheese inside and scallops and prawns on top). If you order one of these and don‚Äôt like it, you must be crazy.

The sweet crepes are also amazing!

This place also has the most delicious iced tea I‚Äôve ever tasted, with a very unique and interesting flavour.

The staff are very kind as well.

I could write much more, but yeah, I really love this place. I‚Äôm very lucky to live just across the street.

Wonderful meal ... AGAIN!! The selections are always tasty and well presented.  Never disappointed and we were happy to bring two couples with us this time. The ""first-timers"" were as impressed with their selections as well.  There is an accessible washroom (single room) which I believe is part of the hotel.  Unfortunately, there are a few things that need to be improved to make it friendlier.  The hook mounted on the door is too high for someone in a wheelchair as is the towel dispenser which requires hand motion to activate it.  These things could be easily fixed by adding a lower coat hook and lowering the towel dispenser.  The room is a good size and the there is an assist bar mounted beside the toilet.


Very good portions, delicious, and the bacon was HUGE and cooked to perfection! Seriously, if you like bacon, then try theirs. The local made bread was a little too crunchy, but she explained that the bread company was concerned the bread was overbaked. I think they should have used different bread because serving it today was mouth painful. I am sure it has been better other days, but today was quite rough. Was overall still worth the brunch. And our waitress was pleasant, fun, perfect and on the hosting ball.


LOVE going to the Bar 500 for jazz nights. Its a cozy atmosphere and not too crowded. The menu is small and the food is delicious. Our only request/recommendation is to add a few monthly dining features to change things up a bit. We would come more often then. All in All, a GREAT venue.


Came in for New Years brunch. Advertised as a buffet for 39.00

Got there and found out it was only 2 coursed for 39.00

1st course was supposed to be bakey plate and fruit. I received a single scone.

My partners chicken and waffles was good. I ordered the crab cake Benny. When the food came I was presented with the wrong order. I had wait 15 minutes for the correct item to be brought. The Benny was unseasoned and bland and the hollandaise was broken.

We watch two other tables walk out as one if them wasn't impressed with menu and the other was upset that there order was not coming out

The breakfast was not worth 90.00. Next time we're going to a real breakfast place.

The seafood pasta is outstanding!! I forgot to take a photo of the chicken sandwich and was so delicious, very crispy outside and soft inside.

Also plenty of gluten free options! This is a BC farm to table style restaurant you don‚Äôt want to miss.


Overall great experience! Started with a condensed milk shaft that I absolutely loved and every dish that followed was great. I ordered the pork and the texture was perfect, very soft and dissolved in your mouth. The broccoli and the cheesecake were also super tasty. I ordered three dishes to share, one cheesecake, and one cookie and it was more than enough for two people so I recommend sharing. Service was great, we sat at the bar and they were very attentive and helpful when explaining portion size etc. I would definitely recommend this place!


Good food, nice staff, and cute atmosphere!

Probably more ideal for groups between 2-5, though I'm sure larger groups can be accommodated for if you come early enough.

No on site parking, but it was easy to find a spot around the block.

However, I do agree with another reviewer about prices. I didn't mind it because I enjoyed the food in the end, but, for what you get, the price does catch you a little off guard. Would still recommend going here at least once, though!


Rice and Pickles bowl, with fried chicken.

Peanuts did not smell like they were freshly toasted, but instead had a musty aroma. Rice was clumpy and not well washed/cooked/fluffed. Pickles were okay, chicken had great texture in the batter but seemed pinkish and the seasoning had not penetrated throughout the meat. Food was served warm but not hot. Mediocre at best.

Service was good, atmosphere close to perfect.
Overall a disappointing experience due to the food.

Appears to be a hidden gem. Deep within darkest Oak Bay, at Estevan Village, is probably Vancouver Island's best Thai restaurant.

Best Thai in Victoria!
Such a delight. The ambience is beautiful, servers are warm and friendly, and the food is incredible. Try the Massaman Curry...incredible.


Nohra Thai is a treat. The staff go above and beyond to share their amazing food. I‚Äôve dined here before and loved it so much I wanted to share it with my coworkers.

Place may not look like much, but the burger and fries I had were fantastic. A big menu which I hope to explore over the summer.


Food was okay.  Fries are definitely homemade and peeled before they are cooked. I saw boxes and boxes of potatoes.  That's what made me stop in the first place.  The hamburger, although advertised as homemade, doesn't look like a fresh patty of cooked hamburger.  Both items tasted fine.  Not sure I'd go back unless it was for my mom to taste the fries.  She's always looking for good freshly peeled homemade fries.  The stand had continuous customers.  Some regulars as the owner greeted the people by name.

Love this spot. The gelded steak and the Moe's burger are so good. Everything tastes fresh, lots of flavour. The berry aioli on the burger is interesting and delicious. Multiple glizzys on the menu too, the Shetl is legit.

Not to mention the staff. Very friendly and accommodating. Simple little eating area with funky old timey music. I wish I lived closer

Don't sleep on Papa Moe's!


This place is AMAZING. We got delivery, and the driver got a little turned around so it took a little longer to arrive, but it was still so delicious. The quality and care really comes through. The bread was perfect at holding my loaded Ruben together. 15/10 will go back!


I just ordered papa moes cheesesteak sandwich on uber eats. It came hot and packed with flavour! It was so delicious! The serving was more than enough, I even shared a few bites with my girlfriend. Really happy with their food and i‚Äôll be a regular for sure!


So Good!! Can't wait to go back!  We ordered the Moe's Burger with curly fries, was very delicious and good quality, especially for only $13!  Service was super friendly and professional, place was clean and tidy, great vibes in there. See you guys soon!

The owner is super nice, and you can tell that they are passionate about the food that they make.
This spot is my go to for takeout when I'm downtown.
Given the small scale, they can get busy quite quickly around the lunch hour, so plan ahead :)


Not bad at all but not all the dishes lived up to my expectations.
The spring roll was delicious (tofu, egg, vermicelli, spinach) and the peanut sauce is perfect. Satay chicken skewers used the same sauce but the chicken itself was a little bland. He was very nice to give us four instead of three! Spicy hard boiled eggs with rice was good, the chile crisp sauce flavourful, coconut rice paired well and pickled veggies was a nice addition. The beef in the rendang was very tough and did not have a lot of flavour, but it could‚Äôve been an off-day because we were the last order.

Keep in mind that the dishes are quite spicy except for the skewers and spring rolls. The chef is very kind and works hard to make all the orders as a one-man team! Get there early as we came back after an hour to pick up our order. Overall came to around $50 for the four items!


Has to be my favourite
Food in Victoria so far! It tasted amazing but it‚Äôs very spicy! We had the green curry and the spicy hard boiled egg dish and wow‚Ä¶ we will be coming back soon!!! Good prices (13-20$/dish)and great location. The owner/cook is very kind too! I would recommend to anyone


Was visiting Victoria and came across this place in Market Square - was NOT dissapointed. Ordered the rolls and peanut skewers and both were absolutely delicious with great flavour. This was my first time trying Indonesian food and definitely won‚Äôt be my last. The cook was a one man show and very pleasant. Expect to wait a bit since it‚Äôs only him but it will be worth it!


I absolutely adore this place!! The food is so packed with flavour, fresh, and authentic.  Bana is so so lovely and sweet I'm absolutely in love with the food he cooks. I wish there were more places like this. Definitely make sure to drop by!! Highly highly recommend!!

I ended up ordering the tasting menu because I wanted to try items I wouldn‚Äôt regularly order and I‚Äôm happy to say each plate turned out amazing.

The amount of food was perfect. The selection was very diverse and delicious. There will be pictures of each dish, so check them out! By far, my favorite dish was the elk leg and mushrooms.

Our chef explained each dish in detail, so I will spare my attempt at doing that and say that if you go, I'd reccomend sitting at the bar. He is very inspired and passionate about his craft. We were lucky the owner was there to bring each glass of wine to life!

I'm very much looking forward to returning for another incredible evening.

Thank you everyone at Hank's for putting love into what you do!

child that the ‚Äúbest‚Äù things came in small packages. If you are one of the lucky ones to get inside this Victoria Gem called  ‚ÄúHank's *A Restaurant‚Äù , then you‚Äôve just won the lottery of an experience like no other.

We ordered and shared the Walnut and Arugula pesto & the Cheeseburger with potato fries . Each bite was like the first time you experienced Disneyland for the first time . Clark , the Culinary Artist  and part owner,  personally checked to see how our meals were. His attention to detail and passion for his craft is why we will return to experience many of the other incredible menu items .

We hadn‚Äôt even finished our first meal experience, and we were already talking  about what we‚Äôd order next time.

A true Victoria Gem definitely worth experiencing !


Here for a quick trip to Victoria and wow walking by saw this little gem. It‚Äôs an absolute must! We ordered the squash, the meatballs and the steak.  The taste, presentation and flavours were out of this world!

We went to this restaurant in search of the best reviews.  We ordered two types of food that tasted relatively good overall but the preparation of the food was very long and it was not satisfactory.  Given the high score, we expected a crowded restaurant, which was not the case. It might not be a bad idea to try it once.


Absolutely delicious. Walked by here so many times over the past few years and finally went in yesterday. We asked for what the owner recommended and it was just spectacular. Husband asked to go back within the month!!


Authentic Mexican food.
Great, very friendly and warm service.  A little taste of Mexico but being in Canada.


Really good Huevos Rancheros yesterday. I can back to try the Huevos Rancheros Mexicans and found it even better, through I liked the Huevos Rancheros as well.

Came back again to try the tamales. I had the chicken which really tasty.

As for the food, the chicken dumplings were absolutely delicious. The filling was flavorful and the wrapper was cooked to perfection - not too soft or too chewy with a little bit of crunch. The chicken teriyaki was also cooked to perfection, with a sweet and savory sauce that complemented the tender chicken perfectly, nice to have it on a rainy day

Overall, I had a wonderful experience here. The food was excellent and had the home cooked feel to it. I'd definitely recommend giving this a go, if you're in the area


Amazing and Authentic food. Mom does it all on her own.

My friends and I make this spot a regular go to when we are in town. Great flavours and just the right amount of food.

Teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef


This was a nice finding inside the shopping alley. A mix of Korean and Japanese cuisine. Not those elaborate menu options but selective items and all for 12$ each was a good option to go for. Served in cardboard boxes with plastic spoins and recyled wooden forks. We ordered fried Dumplings (actually Korean Mandus), Bulgogi, and Chow-mein‚Ä¶ my little daughters loved dumplings and chicken and beef pieces in them. For parents, it was a little bland.

So we won‚Äôt whine about anything. All good. Ladies taking orders and cooking were nice and gentle people.


We ordered weekend special. The food is amazing. Quality of food is great. Felt like eating at home. Highly recommend


A cold chill blows through Victoria, it's 11am on a Saturday, and I walk up to Mom's Kitchen. I order the shrimp udon and wait, watching the bustle of market square. I ate my soup under cover, watching the raindrops drip from the dips in the canopy. Steam billowing from my bowl. This was very wonderful udon.

I'm pretty sure this is going to be my go to spot for any dates or any such outings in the future. It's perfectly setup for having a great conversation.

The music is subtle (but good),the staff are lovely, and the food is excellent. Plus the menu is mostly sourced from ingredients local to the island.

One Cool thing about The Drake Eatery:

If chess is your thing, then I'd recommend you hit this spot with your favorite set and play buddy. It's not like tournaments happen here or anything like that. I just saw a pair playing when I was there and it just seemed like they were having a really good time.


My first impression was the bar is well put together and atmosphere was awesome for downtown Victoria. I enjoy the somewhat open kitchen concept. You have to come up to the bar to order your food. The food is a hit/miss, the potatoes was a 3/10 very dilly. The Beef Tongue Reuben was a 7.7/10. First time trying beef tongue so it was good. The craft beer I ordered was okay. After you order your food, they don‚Äôt really check up on you and ask if you need anything else.


We really enjoyed our lunch at the Drake Eatery. I had the delicious quarter chicken and it was ample for me, and my hubby had the corned beef sandwich which he said was really good.  I really loved the cold slaw salad and dip that came with my chicken and my hubby really enjoyed his home made potato chips, they even came warm!!! The cider was good and so was the wine @ $10 a glass very reasonable, considering it‚Äôs DT Victoria.  The ambience was nice, good tunes and the we loved the Persian rugs, nice touch and made it homey.  Staff were very friendly and accommodating. We will be back! Thanks for great service, food and drink!!


We've visited The Drake a few times, and it's become a must stop when we head to Victoria. They offer a great selection of local and imported craft beers, as well as really nice snack plates. The service is excellent and the folks that work there are super friendly. A great place to pop in for a drink and a bite!


This is our ""Go To"" place for drinks, lunch and a friendly vibe.  The staff is very helpful and welcoming.  We have never been disappointed with any of their offerings whether it be drink or food.  There is a portable ramp at the front door which needs to be put in place for wheelchair access but the staff is very helpful.  There is a single room, accessible washroom as well.

Lots of space inside and out for seating, but busy with dine in and take out orders.

The staff was really lovely and accommodating. They gave me the wrong taco and were quick to rectify in an above and beyond manner. 10 ‚≠êÔ∏è


Went to Tacofino - WOW!! This place has the best tacos I've ever had in my life! I got the Fish, Tuna and Chicken tacos and I was not disappointed. Taste, portion and presentation beats anything else in Victoria!! They have Dino Sour stone fruit on tap and I gotta say it really complimented that to-die-for meal.

I only gave 2 stars as the kitchen REALLY could use a clean. I understand it's super busy all the time but that kitchen needs an entire scrub down, then a plan to keep it clean.

The staff were awesome! The service was great, the hostess and other workers were very nice. Great atmosphere and all around amazing place. I will be returning - Hopefully the kitchen gets some attention after this.

-Will update when I visit again next month, and amend the star rating / comment :)


Holy smokes these were delicious tacos!
I got the tuna taco and the yam taco.
The server recommended getting two and said it's the perfect amount, she was right! They were bigger than I expected as well!
The flavors of each taco were so different and amazing in their own way.
The restaurant is small and filled up very quickly for lunchtime and it was on a Tuesday, I can imagine a wait here on the weekends.
Food was quick and so fresh!
I will 100% be back and recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!


Thank you to the manager Kelsey Van Nes and the whole team at Tacofino for perfect delivery of our order and accommodating a food allergy!

These tacos really packed great flavour and the nachos had a great cook! Vegetarians will LOVE the yam tacos. I could eat those all day! Portion sizes were generous and the tacos came loaded just how I love them.

We will return again!


The praise for Tacofino menu needs no specific affirmations from my end. They are hands down amazing.
The restaurant is clean and well decorated.

WAITING TIME can be crazy even for takeouts ( expect 1 hour wait time over weekends).

TIP:

They take orders over the phone so you should order over the phone before you go in person to pick your order to avoid waiting longer.

But avoid weekend evenings to eat here as sometimes the staff doesn't pick the call as they are already overbooked for in house and take out orders.l understand its not a good customer service practice but nevertheless it's what l experienced myself and decided to share with you folksüòä

Must try from Tacofino:

-Fish Taco :Too good.Cladsic dish and a must try.Well stuffed. Filling and super yummy.

- Fish Burrito : Well made,tastyüéâ,perfect amount of the filling to make you happy.

- Chicken Burrito üåØ: Nice one to try if you want to have something other than fish üêü.

It's a reasonable place to take someone for a date- however not too intimate, pretty casual for a setting.

Date dinner with the Hubby almost a month ago (haven't reviewed), didn't know it was two for one appetizer Saturdays. OF COURSE we ordered the two-for-one! Why not? It's there, if it wasn't something we enjoyed, we didn't have to order it or come back, so there was nothing to lose.

Had no regrets on the selection; ordered the wings with Apple BBQ flavour, and the calamari. Be warned, the calamari does have some spicy kick to it- and I like spicy. Still delicious. Wings were crispy, even with the sauce- just a personal preference.

For the entrees my husband ordered the Halibut burger - but somehow ended up with the two-piece halibut fish and chips- he went with it, and didn't have any regrets. The batter wasn't overly thick, and the fish was thankfully not dry. My own order was spicy prawn tacos, and they were lovely. nice, light, refreshing. It comes with a side, but thankfully I chose this, because the appetizers were filling enough. The fries were nothing remarkable, but I did enjoy them.

We arrived around 5:30pm, to which dinner was just getting started- the tables were about 90% full, and our food still arrived at a ""reasonable time"" (we were in and out in an hour, without rushing our order and dinner).  The atmosphere was overall good; didn't feel rushed, didn't feel like we were inconveniencing anyone when we asked for refills of our drinks. I will, of course, come back again. Even for a somewhat price-conscious person, I'm very satisfied with my visit.

Highlights for me:
Accessible washroom
Two-for-one Appetizer Saturdays (excluding a few items)
Easy parking
Good service and food

Take note:
No dog patio


Absolutely blown away! The food was fantastic.  The best shrimp tacos I've ever had.
Everyone at our table raved about their food, even the kids! I tried some of the cod and chips and the fish was perfect.
The atmosphere is wonderful. You can't get any closer to the water. The staff was friendly and kind. I liked ordering beforehand and it reminded me of how they do things in Australia. If I had a critique, I guess I would have liked to be checked on a bit more to see if we wanted more sauce or drinks, but I was so satisfied with my meal that I didn't realize this until after the fact.
Highly recommend this restaurant.  Take the water taxi right up to the front door for a really unique Victoria experience.
We will definitely be back over and over again!


Great food, nice atmosphere, friendly staff. Not much seating space, and also ordering & paying upfront is not really convenient (especially if you want to add to your order later, you need to line up again). But again, the food was really good so they're getting 5 stars. üòä


Found this place while wandering aimlessly around Victoria. We loved the name and decided to give it a try. It was a little busy, but the hostess gave us the option to sit at the bar. I'm so glad we did. The Otter has an excellent drink selection, including local brews. We split an order of poutine (IYKYK) that was absolutely fantastic! We loved watching the activity on the docks as we ate, including one seagull that liked to look in the windows to see what people were eating.

The staff were amazing and friendly from the jump. They also worked incredibly well together, anticipating what others needed, which increased the level of customer care and service. They elevated the experience tenfold.


We sat in the patio and had a pilsener and an apple cider while we waited for our Caesar salad and halibut fish and chips. The food was great. some of the best fish and chips I'd had. I'd recommend a bit more dressing on the salad but the fried capers that it came with were a nice touch. Our server was attentive but not over bearing. Would go again.

Visited this place while we were in town as recommended by a friend. Upon reading a number of reviews, we ordered a seafood pasta and a calamari since we were feeling still half-full from lunch. They gladly accommodated our request for substituting mussels for more of other kinds of seafood. We were amazed at how everything tasted so fresh, from the focaccia and olives to the pasta! Especially the pasta was simply the best seafood pasta I have ever had (remember we were not too hungry to begin with..)! We loved it was tomato-based rather than oil-based, and the prawns and scallops were cooked to perfection. An added bonus was that our server, Marissa, was incredibly friendly and made us feel comfortable the entire time.

OVERALL:  Nice place with a great atmosphere. Not a great price / value ratio - Good Menu but  needs to improve the dishes. Realistically this place is somewhere between very good 3 stars and bad 4 stars.
DETAILED REVIEW:  Drinks were good and the service solid (Local Draft beers and an OK wine selection). The food was a disappointment unfortunately - we had high hopes. We had the croquettes (these are OK, these tasted too much  bbq sauce), cabbage rolls (good dish, but not cooked properly, the cabbage was still a little uncooked, and not soft), calamari starter (interesting BBQ flavour, ok but not convincing ) -  the paella (large hopes and biggest disappointment. Dish was super salty, the mix of seafood didn‚Äôt seem right - it came with broiled fish and grilled calamari steak on top - in a nutshell just weird and not well balanced) + we finished with a grilled foie gras (not great, somehow not a fresh and good flavour + too pricey).

I had the pork cutlet which was mouth watering. I tried the beat salad and carbonara pasta as well - both amazing.

The only thing to complain about, and you can probably tell from the photos, is the lighting! If it's so dark your wait staff carry flashlights to read the menu... It's probably too dark.

Mains: gnocchi (good) duck with beets (yum) fish with pancetta(?) and fingerling potatoes (yum). Party of 4 + bottle of wine = $380 not including tips. Overall, I‚Äôd stick with ordering charcuterie + individual mains, though the variety was nice. Service‚Ä¶our waitress was good though didn‚Äôt bring the requested balsamic vinegar and olive oil.

Had the most wonderful anniversary dinner here tonight. The staff were delightful, the environment was beautiful and the food was exquisite. Thank you all for such a wonderful dinner.


Absolutely incredible meal - from service, to atmosphere, to quality of the fare. We had the lamb, fish of the day, steak, and cured meats (which are made in house), and cheeses. Everything was fresh, well balanced, and very flavourful. One of our new favourite staples in Victoria

We came in at the tail end of lunch time and there are still people ahead of us waiting to pick up their orders. From this phenomenon I can tell that over the years the locals have found this place a gem.
My chicken sharwama wrap tasted delicious. I tasted light curry and yogurt amongst the greens and chicken fillings. The wrap towards the end leaked out oil, while that might just be me not eating it fast enough/ in the right way.
Cashier knows the menu and is friendly. Your order gets brought to you when dinning in. Large glass/ plastic jug of water on the side free to fill.
All the staff are in the kitchen prepping food orders. I know I would feel more comfortable if the tables could be wiped down after each use or at set schedule. Marvelous that diners have been decent tiding up after themselves. Nevertheless, the virus is still around and death number still gets published.


Good portions, priced well, the chicken was moist and juicy and not chewy like other places. The design is also perfect. Best Shawarma In BC  so far I tried a couple more even in Vancouver. The young lady Is very friendly and super nice. One thing to improve slightly heats the pita before you bag it.  Thanks


Decided to follow up on a recommendation to try this place out. Valid recommendation. I tried the bowl with a customized mix of chicken, lamb, and eggplant. All were good but the eggplant was special. Lots on the plate to feed two of us.


I recently had the pleasure of dining at this Middle Eastern/Persian restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by both the food and the hospitality. The maquli bowl, which I ordered, was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The portion size was generous and left me feeling satisfied but not overly full.

What really stood out to me, though, was the warmth and welcoming nature of the staff. From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was greeted with a smile and made to feel like a valued guest. Throughout my meal, the staff checked in on me to ensure that I was enjoying my food and had everything I needed.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious Middle Eastern/Persian cuisine and a warm and welcoming dining experience. I will certainly be returning soon!


The place is nice and the atmosphere is good. Service is good. My problem was the food. The meat was dry and not juicy. In the lafa, not enough salad, no tahini. The portions were kind of small for the price. Limonana is super sweet! Even my kids couldn't drink it. We had big expectations for the flavors and were disappointed.

The best ever! All ingredients fresh and the soup wad seasoned perfectly. The host was super friendly.


Great local eatery. Lunch menu prices are really reasonable, generous portions and include soup and a spring roll. My partner did a fried egg add-on for an additional cost and it was great on the rice dish. Thai iced tea was decent, a little bit on the sweet side but not bad. Their pad Thai sauce is a little on the sour side for me and their mild seems a bit spicy (I would personally get no spice in my future visits). Hence the 4 stars.


It's a small but great place to eat Thai food. Jared is also very helpful and friendly. Careful when ordering Thai original spiciness, I thought western food can never be spicy but they are truly as spicy as chili padi.


What a beautiful place set in a little cute area of town in Victoria. After purposefully getting lost in locating a little place for dinner, I was pleasantly greeted by a very professional and polite and welcoming young man. I was happy to hear him welcome me and when I asked for take out he politely handed me I menu and took my order. After I sat he professionally offered me some water and even poured it for me which shows the etiquette of serving tables as being very impressive. I was delighted and felt at home immediately as I waited for my food. Upon returning home and opening my food I was eager to taste the flavors for I had asked for as spicy as possible. As I enjoyed my food I realize that this was a wonderful meal that had rich flavors, spiced and the right amount of temperature in spice as well as temperature of food. I would recommend this place and would only caution that though it is a small establishment it is huge in flavor and good quality food. My compliments to the chef.


This small Thai restaurant on Cook Street tells a big story in their cooking. Lunch is a treat, with delicious flavorful soup and a spring role with every choice. And there are lots of excellent choices! I had the Gaeng Massaman Gai, which was filling and fresh and very delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant,  for lunch or dinner.

Not much in terms of seating, this is more of a takeout place for lunch.


Had a Belly 2 Belly as a burrito bowl. They happily customized it to my liking with less rice and extra chilli. All I can say is WOW!! What a satisfying bowl. The Thai flavours were pretty authentic and the whole combo works well.

I only wish they put out a few seats like the Greek food truck next door. I would have loved to sit out in the sun and eat it right there.


A group of us travelled from Vancouver to Victoria for an Outreach Clinic(work) and ordered Taco Justice for lunch. Delivery was on time and our bowls were super tasty. I ordered the Belly Bowl (pork) which was SO good. It was pretty oniony but nonetheless I would order from Taco Justice again if I was in Victoria.


I‚Äôd driven by this food truck quite a few times- I finally decided to stop and I‚Äôm glad I did! I had the delicious fish burrito bowl; it was filling and flavourful. Staff was super friendly! I‚Äôll be going back to try their other menu items for sure!


Little taco food truck, for take out and delivery! Really really love the flavour combinations! The burritos are large and have lots of meat, and fresh ingredients. The ""nachos"" are my favourite waffle cut fries, loaded with fresh toppings. Definitely worth your money. The folks running the truck are really awesome as well. Thanks!

Don‚Äôt forget to tip your server or the person taking the payment - most places are tip sharing so it goes to everyone.  TIP at LEAST 20%.


Best gourmet burgers in Victoria! A group of us (around 20 people) went, and had a fantastic time with great burgers. Bin 4 serves quality and quantity. The burger set meals (burger + sides) are worth the money. The meat is well seasoned and well cooked. The meat was moist (not dry at all), and had the juicy succulent flavor.
Recommended:
Bin 19: The big dipper (meal filling enough for a full meal).
As sides, I had fries and Bin 4 house salad. I would prefer fries and onion rings. The house salad is a regular salad, and wasn't the right fit for me.
Overall, a place that serves great gourmet burgers and has a great vibe! Last but not the least, service was awesome, kudos to the ladies for being prompt.


Great place to visit if you love burger and fries.
They has options for both vegetarian and non vegetarian burgers.
Onion rings is must try!
Staff is friendly and service is good.
Recommend to book reservation on weekend evenings.
Good to visit in happy hours as any burgers are usually 11$ if we order alcoholic drink with it.
Large seating options with big heated patio available.
Ample parking available.


One of the best tasting burgers in town. If not THE best. I was surprised with the garden salad. It had a hint of sweetness. Very enjoyable place. Nice seating outside as well. Friendly waitresses. I'd go back ! Baby friendly ! Was a great day in the sun. Lovely just lovely


Late night special of 50% menu-priced burgers (with the purchase of a drink) after 9pm was the main draw!

Plating was a big thumbs up from me, considering it‚Äôs just a burger and fries! That being said, for a restaurant with a primary focus on burgers, the food was mediocre. Definitely better burger stops all over town. A few of the ingredients were over-cooked, including rock-hard bacon and dry onion rings. While the portion size is generous, the quality doesn‚Äôt seem up to par. The beer menu was decent, but the bar classics fell short.

Would come back here just for the late night special and the hangs, but it‚Äôs not to be construed for a premium burger restaurant. Worth mentioning that they were absolutely packed, so although that meant minimal service attention, it‚Äôs definitely a popular spot!

Good food, service & atmosphere. We really enjoyed the flavours of all the small tapas dishes we tried. It is in a great district of downtown Victoria. I would recommend you try this place.


Excellent food. The soup was super good, pepper and coconut. I took the trio platter to try a little of everything. I did expect more for the price ($15) however, it was very tasty. I would recommend to just go with a full dish instead of the trio, you get more for your money. Finishing touch, a nice espresso. I will be back.

I stopped at Superbaba for lunch, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. They make fresh pita breads daily, and that‚Äôs key. You can see them baking the bread in a hot oven. The pita bread is soft and slightly chewy. I got the falafel wrap, and it was delicious. The chickpea fritters were crispy. I enjoyed the fresh and crunchy vegetables in the wrap. The flavours are exquisite. I love their aesthetics with modern flair.

Additionally, I also decided to try the turmeric cookie. Along with the turmeric, I appreciated the rose water. The rose water adds a distinct and unique floral which, in my opinion, is very unique. The cookie had a good texture, with a slightly crisp outer shell and a soft and chewy middle. Highly recommend. Next time, I shall order ahead.


Ordered the spicy falafel bowl for lunch. It took a bit of time but was worth the wait. Fantastic flavour and a good slow burn when finished. Add this to the go-to list for lunch! Next time I'll order ahead.


The fries I got were burnt. Also the quantity of the chicken in the platter was so little as if someone deliberately put less. The food tasted okay but that meal was not worth the money at all in terms of quantity. Not buying again anytime soon. Vancouver location has much better service.

The staff have all been really amazing as well. Great service and great manager. Also, they have a patio behind the restaurant where we were to have our dog with us. Oh ya the ice cream is seriously awesome too.


For me and my family the best vegan place to visit in town and have a hearty meal. Don‚Äôt worry about ordering any item on the menu if you‚Äôre a vegan as everything is plant based even though the names might suggest otherwise.

The pizza‚Äôs are really light and have lots of variety. Flavours are a lot different than pizza‚Äôs from chain restaurants. Of course this is attributed to the fact that it‚Äôs not regular cheese in there and all plant based toppings. Try to order a couple of them at least if you are two or more people.

For Dessert we had one of their Sundae‚Äôs and it tasted good with the in house made waffle cone.

A few starter options and salad to go on the sides as well. All in all we always love to go back and try out different items.


We had a few pizzas, a couple salads and the garlic knots. Everything was really tasty! Great flavour, the crusts were really lovely and the service was good. Would definitely eat here again.


You would be surprised how insane vegan pizza can go! When I first heard about Virtuous Pie, I didn‚Äôt even know it was vegan.

I really appreciate the sheer amount of pizza‚Äôs this place has. For having many dietary restrictions, the food has a ton a flavour and large variety to choose from. Prices are a little higher than average, but the quality does support the cost. Also really enjoyed their lemonade type drinks. The one with pomegranate stuck out to me.

One thing I would highly recommend is to double the amount of pizza‚Äôs you usually order. They are much smaller than normal.

I love the modern and clean look of the location, plenty of space, and wonderful service!

Taste: Excellent

Service: Excellent

This is the best vegan pizza I‚Äôve ever had! üçï They know what they‚Äôre doing and you can taste it! It was my first time here. I loved that they have huge booths in the main area and seats back in their garden patio. I decided to go for the classic Margherita pizza. The pizza was delicious and tasty. To be honest, you don‚Äôt really miss the dairy/cheese on the pizza. The pizza‚Äôs crust was amazing and not soggy at all. The service was good. Additionally,  I got the vanilla bean ice cream pint to go and it was phenomenal. All in all, I highly recommend Virtuous Pie and I shall return to try other pizzas and items off their menu. üíØ

It was a super long wait for two people both days we went, and we ended up going for an early dinner right at 5pm in order to get seated. I got the bibimbap and my husband got the ramen, and together, we sampled the bao.

The food was tasty enough, but: nothing was authentic, the bao was over sauced / overly salty / + soggy, and the bibimbap was not nearly as flavorful as it should be. Service was okay but not great, as it seemed they were understaffed.

We devoured the delicious food just in time to walk around Chinatown before heading to the ferry to go back to reality.


Presentation looked good with a trendy atmosphere but we ordered take out as it‚Äôs easier with kids as we stayed a block away. We found the soup base with the tan tan men and port belly ramen a bit too salty and not the flavour we were looking for. The buns were good but a bit small and on the pricy side at $4/each. We liked the chicken in the bitmap but the pork was all soggy from curry sauce. Not sure if this the same Bao in Vancover which we‚Äôve never been to but just had higher expectations as were a bit disappointed.


LOOK NO FURTHER! This is the best place to eat in China Town, hands down! For starters, hubs and I are in our 40's, parents of teenagers, restaurant owners, and brought our large vacationing family to Bao from other blogger recommendations. We couldn't be happier that we tried it out!! Everything we tried was amazing, the 13 year olds loved theirs as well! Small, quaint, clean, fast, friendly, and absolutely delicious! We can't wait to visit Bao next time we go to Victoria!


My sister and niece couldn‚Äôt stop raving about this place so when a buddy from out of town asked if I wanted to meet for lunch I suggested we try it out. We were very impressed! Decided to try 4 different Bao and split them, along with an order of Korean Fried Chicken Bibimbap. We also ordered a couple of Vietnamese Iced Coffees. Everything was delicious! The quality of the ingredients is amazingly fresh and the flavor profiles of each of the different Bao were all delicious and different. We had the Taiwanese. Classic, Chinese BBQ, Pork Meatball Bahn Mi, and the Tonkatsu Chicken Bao. Every one of them was incredibly tasty and the Bao buns were soft and fluffy and so fresh. We thoroughly enjoyed our lunch and would highly recommend trying them out.

10/10 best sushi place. Always the kindest customer service, great prices & reliable food! Really great vegan options as well.


Went there for sushi with my friend. The sushi was actually good, we tried the spicy rolls. The other dish we got was a ramen, pretty good too. The restaurant is cute, but unfortunately the spaces are a little narrow. The waiter was polite and everything, but there was some miscommunication therefore we got there and they gave us a table: once sat, they told us that there were other people waiting before of us, but nobody warned us or anything so we had to get up, go out again and wait to be called inside. Besides that, the food was good! I hope it was just a one time thing :)

I am not a Pho connoisseur by any means, but I definitely enjoyed this simple but very flavorful pho.  I had the basic beef version for lunch, and it was plenty of food, and served extremely quickly.  I liked the sliced Jalapenos served with the bean sprouts to enhance the soup.  I will be back.

Great little spot for a hot bowl of pho on a cold rainy day. Gets very busy around dinner service so go early if you can, otherwise no complaints! I got the house special as i always do, but for some - tripe, tendon, all the interesting fixings may not be appetizing to you. However, i enjoyed it.

Been here twice in a span of 20 days, which is a little too soon for me. Within those two visits, I've both had great services and great food. That consistency is very valuable to me, which I usually give restaurants one visit where the food may not be as good that time.

I may be in a disadvantage for points of view, but I did order two dinner Bento specials in a row. It is typical Japanese food fare, but the value is good for what you are getting, in my opinion. The menu is massive, which can be good or bad depending on your preferences. They have hot pot (shabu shabu) specials on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and they also have featured Korean fried chicken on their menu on my most recent visit.

Being very extremely picky, my complaint would be that the pork katsu batter was too flaky or overdone that it was very delicate on the pork and was coming off too easily. This was on the latest visit. However, still very consistent in flavour otherwise. The server is very lovely, we had the same server both visits. Despite having two tables that are groups, she was very careful in ensuring orders are delivered, and customers got their requests. I realize it's very tedious to keep handing mini plates to customers in tight corners, so props. I like the cart for delivering many orders, it just really helps the server a lot.

The location may be far for some, but I recommend giving their establishment a visit! It does get busy at times, I suggest a reservation if you plan to come in a group.


The sushi Tasted fresh, delicate, my only wish is that I got my sockeye vs farmed, had they offered to fix it when I noticed I didn't speak up for what I wanted better I would have given them 5*, but I will be back as it's the best I've had in victoria, interested to try more.
Their combos are well presented and the food looked delishes, so good I forgot to take a picture before I started.
I oredered the monkey brains, the tagadashi combo and a salmon roll.


Very sweet staff and very delicious food. Loved the service and the experience. Would love to come back and try more stuff on the menu.

One of my favourite comfort foods in Victoria is the caramel chicken. I can‚Äôt tell you what the rest of the menu is like because I love the caramel chicken too much.

I think $16 after taxes is a great deal for the huge portion of chicken you get. Don‚Äôt be fooled by the small box. Great things come in small packages.

If you need doting, fussy service, you may find it lacking here, but I think the service is friendly, fast, polite, and professional. They‚Äôve never gotten an order wrong and they‚Äôve never taken longer than they said it would. Can‚Äôt beat that.

And when the rest of the city shuts down on Monday and Tuesday, Foo‚Äôs got your back. (It‚Äôs a Monday today.)


What a gem! This is what you might call a ‚Äúhole-in-the-wall‚Äù treasure chest of a restaurant, given its humble appearance in proximity to just another liquor store‚Ä¶ but the food was divine! Some of the best spins on Thai classics I‚Äôve seen and tasted and I look forward to trying more. Not the most ‚Äúcozy‚Äù spot given limited space and seating, but perfect for a quick yet quality meal alone or as a pair.


We will be back for more!

Had passed by this place many times, and finally stopped!  Really glad we did.

The s&s pork Belly was really tasty - the green beans were sneaky good!  We also had a daily special - lentil dahlli - which was super good too!  The fry bread was a welcome appy, as it was a unique dish!

Parking is a challenge, but the walk is worth it.

Tried new things this time! Got a platter for 4 to share with.
Really liked the moussaka and lamb! The salad is nice and fresh too. My friends liked the calamari a lot. Their tzatziki is so good! Love it!
Everything was good not nit surprisingly good, still would recommend friend to try Greek food here


Wow was I impressed with this restaurant! The staff was so incredibly nice and the food was off the charts! I had the lamb chops medium rare and they were the best tasting lamb chops I've EVER had!!! The cook and the seasoning were absolute perfection. We shared the flaming mozzarella for an app that was truly delicious. I would highly recommend eating here. You won't be disappointed....I promise!


It‚Äôs so beautiful there, really friendly and disciplined staff. The chicken souvlaki was great. Lamb shank was a over priced. Three star because the potatoes were super salty, a pinch of salt is understandable but this much of salt was a surprise for such a well rated restaurant. I had a good experience because it represents Greece but probably not the best choice of food for a Greek restaurant. They can do better on the dishes for such a great place, but the tase was not extraordinary.

The menu was printed on regular piece of paper by a default font Microsoft word, absolute minimum effort, really?! It needs a better one.


Update on November 17, 2022:

My statement is pretty clear all the time. The reason why we are so mad and disappointed and left a 3 stars review is because: Our server that night, after we found that parchment paper from our food, he DID say sorry to us, but he DIDN‚ÄôT take the INITIATIVE to say anything about something will be complimentary, or what the thing(parchment paper) that my friend ate and found was. He DIDN‚ÄôT take any INITIATIVES to SAY something, such as ‚Äúsorry about the experience you encountered, we will offer you‚Ä¶‚Äù Or even easier ‚Äúwe will make sure that will not happen again.‚Äù
Are these really hard to say? We want to see their attitude and hear about the explanation about what they would like do to solve this problem, but they didn‚Äôt. Taking the initiatives and having communication with your customers are important.

I can apologize for my friend‚Äôs aggressive tone when she asking what the thing was in our rice. But we are the one who almost swallowed the parchment paper, not anyone else.
Here is my apology to the server for my friend: I am sorry for her aggressive tone that might made you uncomfortable, we were upset at that time, because my friend almost swallowed it.

The reason why I left a 3 stars review and described the facts about our experience was because I wanted to see their improvement, but now i just received more arguments from it. But I do need to apologize for some improper wording underneath, because I m not good at using a second language. That‚Äôs it.

====================

Met up with friends here once and ordered calamari, meat ball and creek style fries from happy hour, and two types of souvlaki from the regular menu.
The food was good, but they insisted on serving all the dishes at the same time, but lacked a heater to keep the food warm, resulting in all the dishes being cold, even the fries and calamari.
The service was slow, perhaps because the host put us in a seat above the steps and our waiter never found out when we needed help.
But the most disappointing thing was that we found a small piece of plastic or parchment paper mixed with our food, and my friend almost swallowed it. When we told the waiter about this, his first reaction was to try to destroy it and apologize to us in a careless manner without any explanation.
We all thought this was ridiculous, and although the waiter eventually removed the dish where the plastic piece was found from our bill, he never informed us of any action taken by the restaurant from the beginning to the end.
All of us work in the hospitality industry as well and this is a failure in customer service, whether it is a casual apology or staying silent at all times and not informing the guest that the restaurant is responsible for their problem and what action will be taken.


An okay Greek restaurant with a beautiful interior, and great staff.

Unfortunately, it is over priced. The food was good, but the portions were much too small, and the quality did not make up for it. The restaurant is trying to go for a more fine dining experience by changing their style and switching to this new location, but unless they do something about the food, I don‚Äôt see this lasting long.

The host told us that it was the ‚Äúfastest moving lineup in Victoria‚Äù and, not too long after, we were seating inside.

The atmosphere was very lively and the decor had lots of interesting things to look at.

Overall, the food was delicious! The house-bread was so good that we just couldn‚Äôt stop eating it. We ordered an assortment of appetizers including the Crab Cakes, Meatballs and Mezze Platter; and for mains, we tried a couple seafood pastas and mixed seafood bowl.

The portions were substantial although the amount of seafood in of the pastas wasn‚Äôt as abundant compared to other dishes. Also, some shrimps could have been cleaned better.

We also tried several drinks and cocktails; and, they were nice. We sat close to the bar so, the bartender took good care of us personally.

The rest of the staff was very friendly and diligent as well.


When they say they‚Äôll find you a spot and the lineup will be fast they mean it! It‚Äôs so busy and booming with life in this restaurant and makes for great atmosphere. The food was delicious, we got the Minnesota Fats to start, followed by The Prawn Broker and The Big Easy for our main. We also had sangrias on tap, and a glass of wine each. The service was great considering how busy it is, there‚Äôs always someone making sure every table has what they need and asked for in a timely manner. I highly recommend eating here if you‚Äôre in Victoria, all around great experience.


We stop by this place for lunch and love it! All the staff was super friendly, helpful, and kind. We enjoy talking with them. Everything we ordered from the food and drink was savory! They have such a huge selection of lunch and drinks.
The restaurant itself is small, but they do offer outdoor sitting. Walk-in only. First, come serve. Thursday to Sunday they offer live jazz music. Check them out if you are in the area.


The food (pasta) at this place was amazing!!!

I ordered The Shell Game dish and I got to say it's probably one of the best pasta dish I ate. The only complaint I have was that the size of the food is small so definitely go for size Large as it's just a few dollars more!

The happy hour appetizers were also good.

The service was also excellent although I can see our waiter is way too busy (it was crowded) so he forget us a couple times but he was pleasant nonetheless. The setting is sort of very crowded (tables too close) so that's the only real downside.

I'm definitely coming back here again if I'm at Victoria Island.


This restaurant is what my food dreams are made of. Everything, and I mean everything, was the closest to perfect I have ever experienced. From the clever item names, to the perfectly procured *local* (silk road brand) tea, and the live band. We shared the duck wings (a little spicy, perhaps too spicy for some), and I had the enchantment under the sea salad. Unfortunately, they were all out of salmon, but their grilled chicken did not disappoint. Bring a hefty wallet (worth every penny), your appetite, and enjoy!

Great location to walk to if you‚Äôre downtown, near great shops off government street. Service is always excellent. The atmosphere is quiet and a great layout, not a huge place so at peak times you may have to wait for a table. I‚Äôve purchased takeout as well and quality is still superior to other sushi takeout. A favourite place of mine for lunch. The food is top notch, always peak freshness, excellent presentation as well.


I honestly think 3 stars is really generous. I had high hopes based on the past reviews, but its not that good. You need to make a reservation since it's not that big, and the service is slow and indifferent at best. I think we waited for more than 45 minutes for our food and it didn't arrive at the same time. Im thinking take out orders were given priority. The sushi was fine, but the rice was cold. The salmon and new york steak teriyaki were also just okay and served almost western style.  The beef noddle soup was bland and didnt taste like anything. Honestly, there are better Japanese restaurants nearby, so please avoid this one.


The staff was all nice and it was super busy when we walked in. The food was good, especially the vegetable tempura, but even after the restaurant was no longer busy it took way longer than it should have to get our sushi. There was almost a 45 minute gap between our tempura and the sushi. Besides that everything else was great.


My work colleague rants and raves of this place all the time and had been bugging me to go all these months. I finally did somewhat reluctantly; I had a one-time unpleasant experience eating here with my dad when I was 16 (my older daughter is currently this age just to give you a time stamp) and had bad diarrhea afterwards, nearly missing my first Young Drivers appointment back in the day. üôÖüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Food quality is okay. The sashimi is fresh but not that huge deal that it melts in your mouth and you must go here now that I read in other reviews. ü§î As you can see, the presentation for their large assorted sashimi is very lacking; 15 pieces yes, but of very limited type and for the price? Not a good value to the eye of a sashimi connoisseur. My beef teriyaki was overcooked. They asked how I liked it done, I replied medium rare, but dish was medium borderline well done.

Service was there but quite slow; we were given the bill but took a very, very long time for them to come back for the POS. I mean, why bring the bill if you're not ready to accept payment right then and there, and made to wait? ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

No stomach upset this visit which is a plus but even ordering their two biggest entrees, I left the place hungry still and underwhelmed. I feel this place is overhyped, would only go back here with accompaniment, and would most likely order something completely else on the menu. üôéüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è


Make a reservation, because the fact that our reserved group of 6 (the max they'll reserve for) went on a Tuesday evening and the place was just packed, says it all. Really good food; really good service. If you love sushi, do not miss this opportunity. And if you have celiac disease, just ask for gluten-free options and they'll have you covered. I went there with my gluten-free Meetup and it was excellent. Reasonable prices too, considering the times we live in. A great date-night idea in the heart of downtown.

We had the traditional crossing the bridge and the seafood. Both were amazing and had a bunch of ingredients I'd never heard of before. Definitely delicious. Also tried the healthy juice. Tasted like a strawberry white wine, it was very nice.

They were out of the fish ball soup I wanted to try but that wasn't a big deal at all. Next time I would try the cold pigs ears because that sounds exceptionally interesting.

Just barely knocking off a star for the service. Fairly quick seating but it did take almost 15 minutes to receive a menu. There were only two servers on that night and it was quite busy. They were very obviously stressed and running around. If I went again I'm sure I would amend my review to 5 stars. The waitresses could have just used an extra hand :)


Nice restaurant located in Victoria Chinatown near the Fan Tan Alley. Their feature is cross bright noodle soup from Yunnan. To be honest not the worst but not the best either. Feels like the soup base add a lot MSG because very savoury. The portion is not big each ingredient like only one or two bites. Noodle doesn‚Äôt feel fresh it‚Äôs pre-cooked. If just for simple dinner that‚Äôs okay but don‚Äôt expect too much fancy.


ONE OF THE BEST NOODLES I‚ÄôVE HAD IN MY LIFE!

Not only it was a great experience of serving ourselves the noodle mix, the taste is incredible. The waitress is also very nice, very fast service.

Their pork ribs is also a must try, and their pork belly is also good.

Definitely coming back when visiting victoria & its chinatown.


The food was so great and the price of it is reasonable. It is also good for a whole family to have dinner or lunch here. I like the decoration and music playing in this restaurant as well. I really enjoyed the delicious broth and rice noodles in this restaurant and the waitresses told me that it took around 8 hrs for them to make the broth every day!

More importantly, although there were full of people in the restaurant when I was eating, the waitresses tried their best to bring the drink and food for me as soon as possible. There were just two waitresses and almost all of the tables were full, so I think they already provided their best service and all of the customers in the restaurant also waited for them patiently and didn‚Äôt rush them.

What a nice place and people here were happy. I would definitely come here and enjoy other dishes soon!
100% recommend!!:)


Not a big fan of the ""crossing the bridge"" noodles but A BIG FAN of all the other traditional Yunnan dishes we tried: Cured beef, spicy braised chicken, sweet and sour marinated veggies, spicy seaweed, etc. We love those and will be back. The restaurant was quite popular that it ran out of food 1h30 before the closing time.

We ordered a teriyaki chicken and tuna sushi bowl. The food was ready within 10 minutes and both dishes were very fresh and tasty. The tuna bowl with the spicy sauce (called Gochujang if you are familiar with Korean food) was filled with flavor.

The owner provided more than excellent service - she brought us some cold water while we were waiting for the food to go and perfectly packed the dishes at our convenience. Her hospitality was one of highlights of our trip in Victoria.

I'd recommend this place to anyone who wants fresh and healthy meals.


I had no idea that a truly authentic Japanese eatery place exists. This restaurant is located on the first floor of a building. I walked by it many times.

Food is authentic. The couple (Magarete and Don?) running the restaurant make truly authentic Japanese/Korean style food. They are super friendly. The food tastes like what I had in Japan. My avocado sushi is delicious. Reasonably priced.

Great value for the price you pay. I would go back to try other vegan Japanese food without any hesitations.


Great counter service and lots to choose from! I ordered avocado rolls, a Philly roll and a Teriyaki Noodle Box with Veggies and Tofu. They've been here for 9 years!


Not only is the food great here, but the customer service is some of the best I have ever seen.

The owners are so nice and courteous, and provide detailed attention to each customer.

I got the grilled chicken roll and it was so fresh and delicious. You can tell they use good ingredients here, and really know how to make proper Japanese Sushi.

I definitely will be back to this great establishment.


Incredible food with the friendliest hospitality! I was amazed that the owner knew so many of her customers by name. My favorite is the Unagi roll

I had the full Rebar salad that was both filling and delicious. The lemon square for dessert was just the right balance of sweet and acidic. Staff were friendly and efficient. Enjoy!


We walked here for lunch on Wednesday and arrived about 1230.  There was no wait and about 6 or 7 other occupied tables.

We were quickly seated and the waiter came by twice as we weren‚Äôt sure what we were going to have and were busy chatting.

The food came out pretty quickly and looked fantastic; we had the Rock Fish Tacos, a rice noodle/peanut salad and an egg sandwich.  All were very tasty and a pretty good portion!

We were however disappointed with the service after we got our food‚Ä¶like we had been forgotten.  Not once did anyone come back to check on us - we had 3 empty glasses on the corner of the table for more water and sat with empty plates for quite sometime.  We attempted to gain eye contact but never achieved our goal.

It was only when we went to get up to find someone to get the bill were we acknowledged again.  I am not sure if they were low on staff but it is not a large restaurant and they could have least pop buy one more time to see if everything was alright.


Perfect location, Nicely prepared food with sufficient portion size. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs a Vegetarian restaurant but that makes them unique restaurant, which serves healthy and hygienic food.

The server was knowledgeable about recipes and quite helpful. Menu is well designed. Although less food options in menu, the quality of food is superb with balanced flavors and taste. We had ordered 1 enchilada and 1 pad Thai noodles with 1 miso soup and 1 dal soup, and it was more than sufficient for a family of 5. Everything was tasty and filling. My wife had severe headache, so, requested tea with ginger and mint and the server and chef tried their best to get it done. Nice gesture. One must pay a visit, it‚Äôs really worth it. Lunchtime visit is preferable to avoid rush and wait. Interior and tables are simple but clean, little upgrade in tables and toilet will take the restaurant to top in the area.


Great casual place with delicious, healthy food.  The Super Bowl was delicious and a good portion size. Peanut noodles were creamy and again a good size portion. Atmosphere is upbeat but also relaxing. Highly recommend!


The produce was really good but the eggs were over cooked and the had browns were burned. The vegan bowl was too oily and the sauce bland. The atmosphere was really nice.

I ordered the chicken sandwich and it was pretty much a bunch of gristle and bits of chicken. I was fully expecting to bite into a nice juicy piece of fried chicken but that didn't happen at all. After all the hype from my friends I expected a lot more out of it. I've been to a number of other chicken places around town and those are much better in comparison. I'll be returning to those places instead as I know I'll get a good meal.


If you want deep fried batter then that's what you get.  Oily tasty goo with a bit of chicken.  Since I couldn't find much chicken in my first bite as the batter was overwhelming I thought I would take apart two pieces of their chicken to see how much was batter and bone versus chicken meat. Say 60 to 70% is batter with bone and 30 to 40% is chicken.


Had the chicken sandwich meal, which was fine. The chicken itself seemed to be a thigh, and a pretty anemic one at that. This sandwich is absolutely not worth twelve dollars -- even in this hyperinflation new world.

I waited 26 minutes for my order even though when I ordered, the restaurant was totally empty. It seems like this business heavily prioritizes Skip the Dishes over it's in-store diners.

A couple came in nearly 8 minutes after me, ordered a chicken meal, and ate it before my meal even arrived. A cashier told me my order was still coming, but it takes longer because it's a sandwich -- I'm still trying to figure out the logic of how a single chicken thighs could take 26 minutes to deep fry unless someone plain ol' forgot to make it for 15 minutes; but fine.

What kills me is that the FLAVOR was great. The sauce was fantastic, and the wedges were flavorful if not a bit undercooked.

Probably won't be back after that experience, but you should give it a shot if you haven't had Korean chicken before.


Make this your Korean Fried chicken stop!

Honestly very surprised with the 1 star reviews as I had the complete opposite experience (more than once) ordering from this location.

I called to make a take out order of 2x full set of wings. 1 order was half and half (sweet honey & soy almond) 1 order of sweet & spicy. Both box‚Äôs were heavy when I picked them up meaning we were getting what we paid for.
What I personally like if some wings are boneless, this time around I had more than usual and I love that! They are tasty, savoury & filling!

When I called, they mentioned a 15 min wait and they held up to their word. Again, not sure about the lower star review but my experiences have been nothing shy of great which also reflects in the food.

Thanks for the good dining experience!


Best Fried Chicken in Victoria!

We were driving around the area today (7/13) and for the first time, we decided to try this restaurant called Chicken 649 that people have been raving about.

We ordered the 1/2 & 1/2 meal. This came with The Original Crispy chicken and The Yang Nyeom (Korean Chicken:Just enough Spiciness) üòãüòãSo Yummy!

The Filipina behind the counter (I forgot her name üòû) was very Professional, Helpful and Friendly. She even helped out an older gentleman to pick up some of his change, that he had dropped while He was eating his dinner.

Everything was delicious and unique. There is a new tasting menu every month and we can not wait to go again. Highly recommend.


Read the reviews and had reservations of what my food will be like. However, was surprised that it was actually very decent! Food was really good. Flavours were adventuress and wild! Not your everyday steak and seafood restaurant.

Only negative is that it's definitely not the cheapest thing, however, I can see that there was a lot of thought put into every dish.

Zambris has always been a favourite restaurant. So, when my husband and I were planning our wedding, it was a total fluke that we were ordering takeout and then mentioned events. About a year later, we were hosting our small wedding reception in the atrium of their building. And as always, Zambri‚Äôs delivered on the food. From the antipasto, pizza and amazing cocktails to the drool worthy multi-course tasting menu. They nailed every dishes, each more delicious than the last. The crispy broccoli and panna cotta were especially a hit. Not a single guest went home feeling hungry. In fact, in the months since our wedding, our guests have raved about how amazing the food was. It truly stood out. In addition to the food, I have to mention the staff. They really went above and beyond. I never saw an empty wine glass. We had little ones at the reception, and the staff were so kind and patient. We can‚Äôt wait to celebrate our wedding anniversary for years to come at Zambri‚Äôs. This place truly holds a special place in our hearts.


Ordered their seafood dish of the day which was halibut and it was good. The server at our table was a bit odd with me and my colleague. She was nice but didn't collect the empty plates from my colleague when she was long finished with her meal while trying to take my plate while I was still eating and working on my plate.

That was slightly off-putting to say the least especially while the two of us were having a good conversation being regularly interrupted then not clearing the actual empty plates sitting on the table each time.

I'm hoping next experience will be better but it's not enough for me to feel convinced in returning on my own accord.


Focaccia was good  would have been great it was warm. Had the house red, can't remember what It was called but it was really nice. Food, filled me up nicely and had a decent balance. Not too strong or overbearing while having an overall great taste

All the food was terrific, even the soup, salad, and bread (which came with a tasty spread), and all is made in-house, including the pasta and desserts, which were delicious‚ù£Ô∏è. The service was professional and friendly by all, and our server Raimondo was well paced, with a warm and humorous demeanour, but still efficient and attentive.  This restaurant is a must experience for all in Victoria‚ù£Ô∏è $$$


We came here for our birthday dinner after hearing several recommendations from locals. We made reservations the night before, but I would do it several days out of possible. Everything was so yummy! We shared a salad and main dish. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful.


Service was fantastic. Food was really good. Presentenatin felt really upscale. The best part was the patio. It was absolutely beautiful and hate heat lamps. You will need a reservation, if it's summer reserve the patio

Perfect fancy date night bar. As a tourist, I went out of my way to find a non-tourist cocktail bar and they delivered. They have an eclectic and extensive assortment of spirits. Knowing it was dedicated to historic bar masters I had high hopes, but it truly exceeded my expectations. Anytime I'm back in Victoria I'll be visiting again.


My first time eating here was for my birthday. I had read the reviews and had some friends talk about their experience.

Over all not a bad experience. we were seated at the bar, was able to watch the bartenders make cocktails. Service was good, it did take a while to have our order taken.

Although the food was good, I did find the price a bit high based on what was received. I understand a lot of factors go into building the price list, I just thought for a spot that is claimed to be one of the best in YYJ, my expectation was higher than what was received.


Came to this restaurant after our wedding to celebrate as I‚Äôve heard good things, even our wedding commissioner was recommending this place, however I think the hype it‚Äôs overrated, for our visit to say at least, the cocktail menu is nothing impressive or innovative, the salad and the mussel are both meh, the pasta was under seasoned, the wine could get reduced a bit more as you can still taste the alcohol, only thing better was the duck wings. Service was good but the food is not worth going back for.


Hubby and I were celebrating our honeymoon in Victoria and decided to check out Little Jumbo. It was a really nice atmosphere.

The food was quite tasty.. the drinks were strong! Service was pretty good, although the bartender was quite busy so wasn‚Äôt able to give us much attention. When we were finished and wanted to pay for our bill, he was nowhere in sight so we flagged down another waitress to cash us out.

Overall I would recommend checking it out. Apparently the menu changes weekly so you likely won‚Äôt be able to try the same things we did. The scallop pasta was delicious, slightly small portion and a little bit pricy.


Nice little hidden resto bar that was perfect for a way to end the evening. We came in here for dinner but were pleasantly surprised by the late night menu. We ordered fries, crab cakes, shishito peppers, and Tuna tartar and everything was generous portions and very good! Cocktails were excellent, though on the pricier end. Lovely atmosphere üíï

The food was well prepared and the presentation was simple but perfect for this particular place.

We had the Escargot Bourguignon and French Onion soup to start... both very delicious !

We enjoyed the 6oz New York Steak with Lobster... the steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection!

We also had the Shrimp scampi which was served with a very delicate but flavorful white wine sauce... yummy!

Can't forget to mention the fantastic wine and dessert selection! The Cr√®me Brul√©e was one of the best I've had, the Lemon Cheesecake with blueberry sauce was light and flavorful, and the Chocolate Mousse was dreamy!

The hours are 4pm to 8pm... we went as a walk in and were lucky to get a seat; I would recommend a reservation.


Good friendly service and attentive. They had a special for steak and lobster with a salad. The lobster was good but the steak was lower quality for sure. The bread was good though. You will need a vaccine card to dine in. They are only opened during dinner hours.


Celebrated my husband's birthday in this quaint and home style atmosphere. Waitress was attentive. Food was very good. Been in business for 40+ years. Would eat here again


Service was good. But non-alcoholic cocktails contain alcohol. 5 months ago, I had gastric cancer surgery. so absolutely alcohol is dangerous to me. also, my friend's food has a kitchen iron brush. My birthday dinner has become a risky meal.


4/5 and 4/6/23:  It‚Äôs not often good cuisine meets stellar service and wonderful atmosphere!  As a solo diner, I didn‚Äôt feel slighted and was seated at a window table.  I had the spaghetti bolognese on day 1 and returned to have steak & prawns with the house salad on day 2.  I was a happy grandma.  Thanks, Julie!

Inside the restaurant is romantic, dark, and moody: perfect for a date night, evening cocktails, or having an intimate night to yourself.  They have a closed patio as well as an open-aired one though unfortunately it wasn't open when I visited.

Leah was our server who was methodical in how she went about the steps of service.  Amy also stands out to me in her role as a support staff/host.  Overall, the staff were quality: laid back but also seemed to care for their work.

I came for a Sunday night dinner so regrettably, the pasta dishes weren't available reducing the choices in entree.  However, their rotating specials of the day were a nice addition ensuring greater variety.  This also implies they utilize seasonal ingredients and come up with new dishes in addition to the set menu-- probably more fun for the kitchen staff too!

I ordered their special of the day: Eggplant Parmesan ($26) which was delectable.  I loved the addition of roasted vegetables (including potatoes, broccolini, sweet peppers, and carrots) to brighten up the otherwise heavy dish.

I would recommend this place for those in Victoria and craving a good Italian meal with a charming atmosphere :).


We came here on a Friday night.
With a reservation, we didn't wait to get our table. The table was located on a loft, feel sorry for the servers who need to run up and down every time.
We ordered Arancini for starter. They were rispy but bland that I had to dip them into the vinaigrette that was provided for the buns.
I ordered full size carbonara. The portion was very generous, but it was very salty. Because it's big portion, I had to finish slowly. It got a bit dry when it got to the end.
My friend ordered a medium rare steak. It came in medium well. The gentleman was nice enough to take it back, replaced the dish, and took it off the bill. The second steak came as medium rare.


We were lucky enough to have get a table on the terrace.  It's very cute with string lights.  Some tables have a propane open flame on their table.  Food was very good.  The pizza tasty an so is the pasta.  Not exceptional but very good.  The waitress was super nice.  Definitely reserve because it gets very crowded.  A casual good eat.


One of the few places still open after 10pm in downtown Victoria which is the best part. Sad part is restricted menu of Pizza and a few other things if you are hungry.
Their gourmet Pizza is nothing to brag about, but it is quite decent. The desserts are OK.

Service is great.

But you definitely have to try it out if you are in for a midnight snack kind of thing when roaming downtown Victoria


We ate dinner outside on a beautiful day. The evening can be chilly but we sat right under the heater. It was perfect! My husband had their beet salad and loved it. We shared some brussel sprouts and they were soooooo good...very crispy on the outside and very flavorful. We shared a pepperoni pizza and the meaty one (can't remember the name) Both were delicious but the meaty one had a nice spice to it. A great dinner to end the day.

Cute area for the restaurant with a nice outdoor seating/waiting area on the side of the building. Highly recommended!


Last day in Victoria and found this little local and fresh spot! Read some of the reviews about how ""it's not the same as it once was with new ownership"", yatta yatta ...didn't let it phase me as I have never been here before so there's no way for comparison. The spot, in my opinion, does not equate for a bad review whatsoever!

The food is fresh and local, as the people of BC adore and prefer...and as a fellow Canadian I prefer that as well.

The service wasn't extremely fast or slow, which is perfect balance for little dives like this.

I had the Conrflake Chicken Burger, and added that bacon as well. A nice portion of well cooked fries came with it for about $19.00 CAD, as to be expected these days. Tasty, juicy and nothing was dry, just very fresh from top to bottom!

The only suggestion would be for the burger to have a little bit, just a little bit more sauce, yet it was still delicious.

If one has not been here before, previous or new ownership, I highly recommend to come and give it a go. Not disappointing at all! ü§ôüíØ


The new owners here are very nice! They just added a butter chicken poutine to their menu and it was INSANELY TASTY. And a very generous portion of chicken, cheese and sauce! We will definitely have it again!


This is the best burger. Period. I live close by and go with others fairly often. Had the beef - excellent; lamb - outstanding; chicken - also great. And the veggie burger is the best ever. Better than Big Wheel and Bin 4. Ordering on line is seamless and it‚Äôs always ready in 10 mins or less. Go. Now.


The food was not good. The chicken strips were dry and stringy. Some of the fries were raw, as in uncooked potato. The fried fish was moist, but the batter tasted strongly of curry. The menu does not say curry flavored fish n chips, so they are not separating the items.

The staff is friendly and maybe they will improve their cooking. The meal was not worth the money, so I do not plan to buy from them again. Yes, I did like the old Hive and this is very different. It is not just a matter of taste, they are not preparing the food properly. Raw fries.

They make it daily, I had to eat it slow to savor every bite. We are visiting from Ontario and if you are in the area and want amazing quality food at good price, visit here during happy hour ( based on the time change it was dinner time for us anyway üòÇ).


A very nice meal at Lot 1. We started with a bottle of red wine and their Lot 1 Roasted Garlic Herb Bread ( March feature ) It wasn't what we were expecting as it's very similar to a deflated focaccia but it was tasty. For main, I ordered the Moroccan Chicken Rigatoni minus the red peppers, added extra cashews. Very flavorful, great portion size and a little bit of an unexpected heat. Finished the night off with the white chocolate cheesecake minus the raspberry sauce, maybe a little to much caramel. An excellent desert paired with a glass of red wine. Overall a great meal. Server was great, very tentative. Will be back.


We went here very famished and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Our server was very friendly and accommodating. We had some complimentary snack and had my toddler‚Äôs spaghetti custom made! We left feeling full, satisfied and happy. Servings were huge and good for sharing. Good food and great service, highly recommended!


Great find for amazing pasta in Victoria!
I am so so glad that I decided to pop in here one evening. The range and quality of the pasta dishes is excellent - the bacon and mushroom ravioli was just outstanding.
Add to that a great selection of cocktails and the BEST brownies I think I've ever had, and Lot 1 Pasta Bar is an easy recommendation to make.
The venue is clean, tidy and appealing, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.
Thank you to all of the staff for a lovely evening and excellent food!


Very tasty pasta served in nice large portions so you will definitely be full and happy. Good happy hour deals including mussels, baked brie, and giant meatballs. The polenta bites are particularly tasty. All the pasta dishes tasted very fresh and the ravioli was particularly delicious. The downsides are that the pork belly was quite dry and they advertise fresh squeezed orange juice from real oranges but when I got served mine it was most definitely not fresh squeezed orange juice but boxed orange juice. As someone that regularly drinks fresh squeezed orange juice the difference is night and day. You can even see in the picture included that the color of the actual orange slice they added is completely different than the color of the juice they served which was opaque and tasted like a Tropicana variant. If it's not fresh squeezed, they can just be honest and put it in the menu as orange juice instead of ""fresh squeezed orange juice"" as it's false advertising.

What an incredible restaurant!
The beet appetizer has such a great texture. The dumplings had the most delicious peanut sauce. The lamb and pork were both cooked beautifully. The potatoes and vegetables on the side had perfect seasoning. The Demi glaze was perfect with a beautiful rosemary flavour. The mascarpone cheesecake with blueberry and lemon was truly delightful.

A neighborhood high-end restaurant that starts serving dinner at 4pm.  Chef also runs front of house and greets customers herself.  Recommend calling in for a reservation as the restaurant is short staffed.  You can discuss your dietary restrictions with the chef and request to add extra protein or carbs to you main dishes.  Pasta and fish dish changes daily.  Lots of cocktail and wine selection.


Lovely neighbourhood restaurant with extremely fresh, tasty, and comforting meals. You could tell they were made with love. We had the gnocchi to share as a starter, ribs, and then sampled all the desserts‚Äîthe sticky toffee pudding was to die for!

The owners are also incredibly nice, which made it a really fun dining experience.

Oh, and well-priced cocktails, to boot!

Nubo will absolutely be put on the must-go list for next time I'm out.


We were looking forward to our anniversary dinner here. The service was good. The seating was good. And if you like rice with a bit of fish flavoring on top, you'll love this place. We prefer a bit more fish in our sushi dinners. We ordered quite a bit with our tab over $100, and if there was more than 2 oz of fish between our two meals I'd be shocked. Lots and lots of rice, though. Did NOT look like the pictures. (Maybe it was because it was Monday and they ran out of fish from the weekend? Who knows. We won't be back to find out)

Overall experience: Meh.


We ended up ordering several dishes, not all I photographed. The cocktails were definitely the highlight of the night, most of the food we ordered was underwhelming and came in tiny potions. The Unagyu roll was mostly rice... Sadly. I've never seen a sushi restaurant be so light handed with the fish. The Earl Grey mar tea ni was the best drink I had on the menu! 10/10.


The restaurant is beautiful, great location, lots of windows and natural light. Our server was awesome! The food was absolutely delicious and was made so quickly. When I visit Victoria again, I will definitely be stopping in here. Oh and the prices were really great too. 5 stars all around.

We tried the curries and cilantro sticky rice. The curries was more of and Indian style, and the sticky rice was not a traditional sticky rice, but more like a sushi sticky one.

The food was very delicious and surprisingly quick. Having fast service is usually a red flag for me, wondering if the food was fresh or made with quality, but without a doubt, it was made well.

Our waitress was very polite and nice to talk with. She always responded to our ""thank you"" with a ""you're welcome"" she had the perfect balance of attention and checkups to not annoy people with constant checks but didn't leave you wondering if you were going to be served. It was the perfect balance.

The restaurant is small, which does make the noise travel quite far, on the louder side, but being at the bar was a saving grace as volume seemed to be lower there.

Incredible atmosphere that somehow manages to be both exciting and intimate, and like the food, in perfectly balanced servings.

Amazed at the number of flavours and ingredients they are able to fit into a sushi roll without falling into the ""westernized sizing"" that so many similar establishments seemed to have adopted. Delicate, balanced, and satisfying without being a meal ender.

For those who enjoy all the various food media these days, and have wanted to experiment without signing up for a large, unknown dish... the Tapas style and extremely affordable menu makes multiple visits not only a must, but a new, yet familiar experience with each visit.

Attentive yet subdued service finishes the dish perfectly.

Balance and thoughtfulness are the threads throughout which the entire experience is woven.


Really good place to get sushi and other Japanese dishes. It was a very busy night but they were able to accommodate us swiftly. Love the aburi! Service was outstanding and the food came quickly for us. Quite a variety of items on the menu that are moderately on a high price point but the quality is there. Definitely would come back.


Absolutely DYNAMITE! Fabulous taste, and great drinks. I never knew how good pesto could be on a sushi roll, but here we are. The Fish and Chip roll, the Victoria Secret roll, and the Pickle Me roll were my top three favourites. A bit pricey, but so very tasty. Take yourself there as a treat and enjoy every bite!


Great staff who were very attentive! But compared to the many other Japanese spots on the island, this was lackluster‚Ä¶ drinks were alright but nothing special. The wild salmon roll spoke to me but in general the offerings were overpriced for what they turned out to be.

@Victoria_Foodies


Great little restaurant in Victoria‚Äôs Chinatown with outstanding food and really nice atmosphere.  We had the tasting menu of 7 courses if you count bread and petit fours. The food was absolutely amazing, Chinese milk bread with charred scallion butter, a trio of Chinese street food which include lamb, halibut and a scallop pure beautifully presented to be eaten with chopsticks, then we had cucumber where the water was replaced with champagne, served with thinly sliced albacore tuna, a halibut dish where the halibut was melt in your mouth with a miso buerre blanc, lamb with soybean cassoulet and a delicious dessert with white chocolate toffee sprinkle. Every dish was perfect. The wine list and pairing are also very well done. My only complaint is the timing of the service. A little too long between courses. Service was attentive and the servers were very friendly, but the kitchen needs to tighten up their timing. I love a relaxed pace, but it was just a little too relaxed. Despite that, I highly recommend this restaurant!!! Chef has nailed the food!!

Meet is a very interesting place. First off they do not serve any meat products, The food is loaded in flavor and vibrant in color, and alive. My employer said it is the best vegan Burger he has ever had, every place he's been. My meal was spectacular. No words could explain. I ordered the big yum. That's exactly what it was, very delicious. Yum yum yum. I'm definitely gonna go back and I want to bring a date this time There are a lot of people in the city who are missing out Well worth the wait Just stay in line do not leave. You won't regret it.


This place was OK. I will do a sandwich review with two positives and the negative.

The service was really great and we had multiple people help us.

The food was OK and I found my barbeque burger to be inedible. Way too much spicy and sweet BBQ sauce for one burger. My companions said their oyster mushroom burgers were spicy and not the best either. The fries tasted funny, maybe it was oil they use, and the pieces were small and sharp. It‚Äôs not a compliment when the best part of our meals were the side salads. The fried cabbage appetizer we ordered was good; albeit expensive like all food nowadays.

The decor was fun and funky, and I like the location and how there‚Äôs another vegan option for restaurants in Victoria.

I think the meat and potatoes (pun intended) of a restaurant is the food so I won‚Äôt be going back just because of the service and ambience.


Had an incredible meal at their soft opening, the quality of our food was fantastic! Highly recommend the spinach dip starter, it was so cheesy and decadent. Also loved the mushroom kalamari; Our MeeT burger was delicious, love that we had the option of upgrading to a beyond meat patty. The gnocchi with whipped feta was divine, loved my jalape√±o caesar and spicy margarita. The portions are generous, but we still found room for dessert - my husband loved the lemon tart, I had the cookies and cream and it was yummy!

As a bonus the space is very cool and contemporary and absolutely huge with a big city vibe. I can‚Äôt believe we have such a great restaurant in Victoria! Sm looking forward to trying brunch soon!

Super cool concept here.  Nice room, great staff, food is fantastic.

The family style meal is what brings it home for me (no pun intended).  Let's you enjoy so much more than just your meal... really love this!

I can't wait to go back and enjoy the omakase-like experience where the chef prepares a sampling of their menu items - I can't wait to get back!

Add this to your must-visit list... you won't regret it.


Ummm - where do I even start?

Decor - the whole restaurant is a vibe. The small patio is great for people watching, the front bar area is great for a busier feel, the back part of the restaurant is more intimate, then there is the back patio as well.  It's astounding!

Service - the staff is AMAZING. Very knowledgeable, very personable, and excited about the food and drinks. If you go multiple times (I've now gone five times in five months....) they actually remember you AND the chef makes you a new dish that is NOT on their menu!

Drinks - their extensive wine, cocktail, and mocktail list is divine.  I haven't had a bad glass of anything yet!

Menu - Folks - their menu changes with the season AND what is available from their suppliers.  Which means - it's all fresh. If you are going with two or more people (and you don't mind putting $79 pp) do the Chef's Tasting Menu. Not only is the food high quality, but you get 9 dishes (including a palette cleanser) for that price.  It's all family style (all sharing) AND you get individual tongs for serving.

Make a reservation and head down.

You will enjoy it!!!

I'm sure it changes frequently but from the salad to main course and the dessert were all fantastic. I would highly recommend the place. Just make sure you go on an empty stomach. It's filling. And make sure if you're going on weekend evenings to make a reservation.


The service here is amazing.... The presentation needs work however the food is excellent! I recommend getting the side dishes. Food can be a bit salty by itself. Our mistake. The dishes were all so flavorful and unique. Highly recommend. Make sure to book ahead


Booked a large group event and everything was absolutely perfect. Shayla was so helpful and accommodating with planning the group booking and set menu. Food allergies were handled with care and attention, the service at the restaurant was impeccable and the food & cocktails were amazing! We‚Äôll definitely be back again!

The service was impeccable, the food was beyond what my taste buds could handle, and the decor was astonishing!
I felt welcomed and the service was fast, sweet, and they were able to handle our dietary concerns (no seafood).

The drinks are very well made and the flavours were absolutely scrumptious.

I highly recommend this place for your next birthday dinner, or fancy date night!


Went for an early dinner and were very well served. Tried several of the vegan items on the menu, and everything was delicious! Roasted dumplings, spaghetti-squash with seasonal vegetables and veg-stuffed ravioli. The chef was very accommodating, which we really appreciated. The blueberry lemonade and mango-mint soda were very good too. Flavourful blood-orange sorbet to finish off. Vegans will be very happy here.


A great place for cocktails! I had the Empress 75 and it was delicious without being too sweet! I ate the Best Ravioli (not pictured) and it was so good. For dessert I had the pecan pie, and it was really tasty but hard to eat with a spoon; ask your server for a fork :)


A simply marvelous experience. Some Seattle friends are here to see Nancy Wilson and after the concert, we stopped in for food and drinks. Server Carla is an absolute delight. She provided perfect suggestions and connected well with everyone.amager Rob visited several times and is extremely personable. The food? Phenomenal. The drinks? Fantastic. The perfect after concert experience.


ü§§ I love this place! The spaghetti squash is in another level!
We were short of time and wanted to eat something before taking the bus to the ferries‚Ä¶ they brought all our food on a timely manner as well as the drinks!
Service was wonderful
The next time I come to Victoria, will definitely eat at this place!!

The restaurant is huge so I understood more as we were seated. The design of the restaurant was good but fairly basic and comfortable. It was very busy but I felt like they did a great job getting food and drinks to us. The value of the food was pretty good and they have a great food and beverage selection. The kids meals were generous and tasty. I had the seafood fettuccine Alfredo and I found it quite watery and bland. My sister has the manicotti and she thought it was good. A good family restaurant with mid to high prices.


Gosh! I tell you their spaghetti is awesome. I don‚Äôt take a picture of my food but, because I was so starving that evening so, I forgot to take some pictures. Everything was absolutely delicious and amazing supper. Their warm bread with whipped garlic butter were top notch! Keep asking them to refill and they bring it up on the table. Always make reservation before otherwise you will be waiting for a long time to get your table. And because they are busy, just be patience and be kind to the waitress. They serve you really well.


It‚Äôs Royal Victoria Marathon tomorrow and it was massive line up in front of the restaurant. They told us 2 hours wait at 6.30pm. We end up leaving but we called back around 7 since we didn‚Äôt find any thing else that would be good the night before our marathon. They actually told us we can come back. By the time we came back we were seated and served.  Great service ! I was impressed


Still a fun experience especially with the everything is included aspect of the meal. Judging by thr crowd and people waiting, it's definitely got its fans. The food is as expected, not that bad, but not stellar, everyone should be able to find something they like there.


Food was really good. Service was attentive, knowledgeable, welcoming.

Prices are great and everything-included makes it easy to budget for 4-or-more.

Personnel were great from host to server; seem like they worked well as a team during a busy, busy visit.

On a sunny mid-afternoon I walked in as a single guest. I got taken ahead of walk-in groups of 3+ and large group reservations.

I got visit. Not 'fine dining' but fine enough for me!

Service and customer attention: top-notch 5/5!

Nice cozy restaurant.  Satay Chicken is very good as well as Noodles.. We ordered extra spicy and it was perfect. Nice welcoming staff and lots like a family run business too. Recommended..


Very expensive and underwhelming for what we got which pretty much sums up the Victoria dining experience. Verrrrryy small portions which I don't believe would cut it if it was dining in??? Each dish was basically $20 and this is without rice either


Finally tried this place, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to the reviews. Spring rolls were great. The red curry & the cashew chicken weren‚Äôt bad. The chicken pad Thai was easily the worst I‚Äôve ever had - No flavour and the saddest amount of chicken. I would have returned it if I lived closer.


A great place to eat, with good service, and tasty food.
My only complaint is that they leave the tails on the shrimp when they serve them, but I‚Äôm sure you could ask for the tails off.

We were provided breakfast at Fire & Water Restaurant located within the hotel.

The staff recommended ‚ÄúCrab Cake Eggs Benedict.‚Äù We both went with her recommendation. Wow, she was on point! Rich, tasty and melt in your mouth. Hubby loved it so much he ordered it again the next morning. The next morning I ordered ‚ÄúAll Canadian breakfast‚Äù as I love scrambled eggs and chose rye bread, bacon and substituted potatoes with fruit.

I have to say the staff is amazing - attentive, genuine and down-to-earth.

Great breakfast to fuel us for the day full with walking. We ended up needing to walk off the wonderful meal along the harbour. Not a bad start to a day, eh!


Dropped in for a nightcap and between my husband and I we had 6 delicious drinks.  I asked for a espresso martini which was not on the menu and they delivered it with a smile. Sandeep was very knowledgeable about the drinks that was served and made us feel at home. The bartender really is outstanding at his profession as well as quick.  And the restaurant itself is very clean, cozy, and esthetically pleasing to the eye.


We dined here for breakfast twice during our recent stay at the Marriott. The food was quite tasty and the service was even better! I can‚Äôt remember our waitress‚Äô name but she was super friendly, funny and efficient. I would say it‚Äôs a little on the expensive side, especially for breakfast.

Hubby had the omelette both days and enjoyed it. I had the cinnamon French toast one day and the sandwich the other day. Both were good!


I've been very fortunate to be able to try a wide variety of menu options and everything seems to be excellent quality.

The crab cakes eggs benny is a must try!
Very flavorful crab cakes topped with sliced avocado and a perfectly poached egg, tasty potatoes on the side and a creamy and zesty hollandaise sauce to pour over top.

Buffalo chicken wings were thickly breaded and really delicious.

The seafood chowder was filled with yummy bites.

The french toast was amazing! It had so much flavour on it's own but then it was paired with fruits and a cinnamon whip on the side, you hardly have a need for any syrup.

The Reuben was juicy and not overly salty as others can be.

The calamari was a bit odd and the least flavorful thing I tried.

The steak was my absolute favourite dish, perfectly cooked with a delicious flavoured butter and nice crust on the outside and rich sauteed mushrooms.

The fish and chips were exactly what you'd expect and they do have good fries.

The cappuccino chocolate terrine dessert was nice and rich without being overly sweet, despite it missing the raspberry sauce as advertised. The chocolate was smooth and the almond bark on top was crunchy. I'm not actually sure where the cappuccino flavour is meant to be but I'm an espresso addict so I tend to not be able to taste coffee flavours unless they are overly pronounced.


Service, staff and location is great, low volume radio quality music, Driftwood on tap is Top Notch, food is passable: Mango Bourbon BBQ chicken wings - low if any on flavor and also mushie, blue cheese dipping sauce is NOT Blue Cheese dipping sauce. I am sorry, but Marriott is not what it used to be. Happy Hour Menu is misleading, only drinks are included in the Happy Hour, food is not, even though menu is separated into two sections, see image below. I like to eat, I like to drink, I leave good tips, it's not about money, but quite disappointed. Sorry, not sure about my next time in your place.

Chicken tastes great. Overall top quality and reasonably priced. If chicken is your thing this is a great place. They also have pork and other items. Certain will visit again.


I tried many restaurants in Victoria, but the food here was different. They serve delicious food(especially sauce)at reasonable cost. All staff members are very kind and helpful. Also, the restaurant atmosphere was comfortable and romantic. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will certainly visit again shortly.


Been here several times already! The tastiest and moistest chicken I ever had! I also tried the churros and the k-toast, and they were quite good desserts. I‚Äòll definitely visit again üòÑ

Martini was a touch bit on the strong side and don't bother with the coffee if you're looking for a caffeine slap. Overall will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!


Initial seating and getting cocktails was excellent.  Food was disgusting.  Ordered W8 or larb chicken with seasoning and herbs.  No flavour to food.  Looked like dog food/ alpo.  Service was then deplorable.   No one came by to check on meal quality.  Waitresses we noted to be chatting at bar.  Very dissatisfied.  Do NOT recommend.


Nice small and cosy thai restaurant. Service is great all the servers go above and beyond. The food is always cooked so well! Recommend all the soups! Satay chicken, spring rolls, larb, drunken fried rice and also the Tom yum kow pad & som tum (papaya salad) shown in photo üòçüòç


The food and atmosphere is good but if you're ordering for dinner take out or delivery, don't bother. The policy here is that dine-in customers get priority on their orders. Not a strictly bad policy but it leaves take away customers and delivery drivers waiting excessive amounts of time, as in 45 minutes to an hour. I've seen a crowd of delivery drivers and regular take-away customers waiting that long for their orders before dine-in customers would come in, get seated, and served their food in the time span that we were still waiting.
Tonight a take-away customer who was there with me for an hour brought this up to one of the people working there and was told this was the policy and that he just had to be patient as he wasn't there for dine-in. This was also the first I heard of this anywhere and so I wanted to share it.
Great for dine-in though if that's what you're wanting.


Dined in last night and ordered the crispy squid, red curry, and spicy lemongrass fried rice. The food was excellent and some of the best Thai food I‚Äôve ever had in Victoria . The cocktails were also amazing. Annabell was our server and provided us with excellent customer service. I will definitely be coming back!

Wasn't terribly impressed with this place. We tried the homemade sodas which were very strange and we couldn't finish either one.

My wife got the fish and chips. It was overly fried and probably below average for your typical bar.

I got the daily khatch. The seasoning was like average Indian food. Like the kind of stuff you'd get at a $14 all you can eat buffet. The one thing I did like was the Humboldt Squid. It tasted different than normal calamari, was super tasty, and made the whole experience worthwhile. If you're into calamari and seafood and never had Humboldt Squid, this is worth going to. Otherwise I'd recommend passing.


Amazing little restaurant we visited three times.
West coast seafood mixed with East Indian. Great combinations of flavors  and textures.
We had the house chowder and a salmon biriani. Both dishes tasted really good.
Great service and atmosphere.
We will be back!!


So happy we got to eat here before we left Victoria. Fresh seafood and Indian flavors are the perfect pair. The vindaloo mussels and chowder were delicious, wish we ordered some more of the baguettes to sop up that yum. I think the soups could've used more body but they were really good regardless. The fish and chips was a hit with the kiddos, loved the light and crispy batter and the curry aioli.

The staff were really friendly too and service was quick despite being busy (in the middle of the afternoon!). Def worth a stop if you're in the area


Fantastic Indian Seafood fusion spot. So much flavor. Chowder is not the creamy kind, which I liked. Seafood pot was super flavorful. Very unique, very tasty

Good location, not busy and quick service. Foods were much better than I expected, especially the bread came with the pasta. I also love that instead of pepper and salt, they have chili flake and cheese on the table instead. I would definitely be back to try other things on the menu


Take out for 2 pizzas was an awesome experience. Quick and easy placing the order over the phone, pizza was hot and ready right when they said it would be, and the pizza itself was delicious! It was a great deal and we will definitely be back. Finally- a good place to get pizza downtown!


The rice bowl was a disappointment to say the least. I can accept the sweet sticky flavour and the degree of spice what I can‚Äôt accept is the over cooked chicken it was really dry and hard to chew. Once again Romeo‚Äôs disappoints.


Just ordered baked fettuccini Alfredo and ribs and fettuccini side, all I‚Äôve got to say is awful. Noodles stuck together in clumps of 3-4, hard to the bite. Like so far hard and stuck together I‚Äôve never had a noodle of any kind from a restaurant worse. The ribs seemed steamed and tough.

Like this place! It‚Äôs located in the heart of Downtown in one of the beautiful old houses right upstairs. They have cool interior design with authentic pictures and you even can buy some of them. We tried their top-ratting linguine pasta with clams and duck.. both were super tasty! Highly recommended for romantic date or just a nice dinner with friends/family


Food here was very good. Oysters were super fresh and were a very good price during happy hour. I had the Black Cod and it was very good. Cod was cooked very well and as well as the scallops. Great place for good seafood.

Nice indoor eating space, but options to sit outdoors in the front on the street or in the courtyard at the back (we didn‚Äôt know it was there the first time we came!).


We tried this place for the first time today and were excited, given reviews and the lovely service when we arrived. They were out of limes, which is fine as we thought the ones at home should work fine.

We ordered two 5 taco deals with a mix of beef, fish and shrimp to try them out. We came home and opened the box and were shocked by what we found. Tacos with barely any toppings, fish ripped to shreds, little to no seasoning or toppings on the beef and some of the tacos were under-cooked. They were basically tacos with a bit of some sauce and pieces of shredded lettuce. That too with unseasoned meat and ripped oily breaded fish. We were very disappointed, as I was personally looking forward to having tacos tonight. Bummer. Did like their salsas and Valentino sauce was nice and spicy, but the tacos themselves are underwhelming compared even to other places we‚Äôve tried in the city. Again, bummer as the staff was nice.


Authentic Mexican food, like for real. I had a giant burrito with Beef Al Pastor. The meat was so soft and tasty, combined with marvelous beans and cheese that are nothing like you would ever experience at a Tex-Mex Americanized place.

Now the salsa, oh boy the green salsa, savory salsa made just right to be flavourful while still mild. I combined that with some sour cream, perfect match for me. I could eat a whole meal of just chips with this.

A friend of mine ordered their small quesadillas and they looked just as good, I can't wait to try some next time.


Thank you so much for catering our office luncheon today! The setup was very nicely done and the food was wonderful.  Everyone asked me where I ordered the food from.  For the first time out of all the monthly lunches, I didn't have any leftovers. Unfortunately, I couldn't take pictures of all the food but I managed to get a few. Look at that guacamole!!! 


I visited day before yesterday. I love such a welcoming staff and friendly customer service. And on top of that food was so delicious. I am vegetarian and it is difficult to find tasty option in Victoria, but La Taquisa is one of the best place for veg people like me. I would highly recommend to try Tortila soup. ü´∂üèº

We especially loved the mango smoothie. Servings large enough for at least 2 meals - you get your money‚Äôs worth here


I cannot put into words how good the food was. Food has no right to be this good. It was otherworldly. The peanut sauce with our satay was rich and flavourful, but the star was the green curry. It was without a doubt, the best I've ever had. I have been lucky to have had many quality green Thai curries in my rather short life....but this easily stole the number one spot. It was out of this world good. The service was good despite how busy it was, and how late we came in, and everyone was happy, and brought their A game. Phenomenal. You're doing yourself a disservice if you DON'T come here while in Victoria. An absolute must for a superb dining experience. My husband, currently rather tipsy after one of their cocktails (the fizzy peach), agrees. NOW SELL YOUR SAUCES IN OTTAWA PLEASE!!! I can't go without for another five plus years...

Update: We stayed for dessert. Top notch.


We ordered 5 dishes, they looked great but all were too salty for us. But I love the atmosphere here.

Heads up, some of these quaint little houses are available through Air BnB so check before you book a hotel. You can walk right into the heart of the city from there.

Lovely place with colourful buildings on the water. In the place you can see restaurants, ice cream shop, galleries and houses. There are public washrooms in the place. Really nice atmosphere. Next to the place there is a big lawn and small playground. There is a pay parking lot and free parking spots on the street. Highly recommended to visit here.

This is one of the best places to go, as there are so many people and it's a very fun place to meet up with your friends. Would recommend!


This is pretty. Unfortunately we were there on a rainy day. I like colors of shops and houses. I wonder what benefit private home owners get bit allowing visitors walk besides their homes? I do not think it is fun to live there were you would be on the public eyes all the time. I liked seeing houses, shops and water taxes, a pretty picture. We had fish and fries and I did not enjoy fish at all. It was fish with very bland batter and was not tasty at all atheist for me.  Overall it is a mist visit place for sure.

A perfect spot in downtown Victoria for early morning walks, morning runs or just for some sight seeing with breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, sea gulls and if you are lucky orcas passing by. Absolutely must visit in Victoria for all. One can see the marine vessels passing by from the lighthouse. Although can get momentarily noisy from the sound of helicopters taking off near by.


I was walking along and noticed this walk way, turned out to be a nice walk to a lighthouse. Goes out into the ocean then at the end of the walk you can enjoy with a seat and beautiful views 360¬∞ of the harbour and skyline of the area.‚ù£Ô∏è Totally worth it for the views and to chill out at.


It's a beautiful little 800km hike one way. You can walk along the bottom edge on the rocks.. beautiful little spot to see marine life


Awesome lighthouse at the end of the breakwater; the walk isn't all too far, definitely worth it to stroll and enjoy the views, water, wind. Perfect spot for a clear sunset view.

It's great that our indigenous people have a place to display their heritage. I always enjoy seeing the display here. I hope it continues.


Like the totems and of course worth visiting the place once.. free and just in. The corner of street. U can visit that while walking to beach hill park


What a great collection of amazing Indigenous artwork! There are several totem poles of various designs all within close proximity to one another. If you're in Victoria, you should take the time to walk through the park and check out these totem poles!

This is one of the best museums we have visited. It has natural history, art, First People cultural history, and an interactive town/ship/ mine from British colonial history. Really great. Two weeks ago,  that section was closed for remodel. I'm hoping it is still as awesome as ever when it reopens.


Great place to visit and learn about the ice age and stuff. They even had a showing of covid portraits which was cool.

Likes: it was cheap. $5 per person and it was absolutely worth it. Lots to see and learn.

Dislikes: Nothing I can think of


This is such an awesome experience! I enjoyed the Orcas exhibit ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è I loved how they explained things such as climate change, global warming, plastics, saving our mother nature. This touched our hearts.
So far, this is the best museum I have ever been in. I will never forget my experience here and will definitely be back again ‚ù§Ô∏è
I thank everyone who made this possible, the effort you put into this is very much appreciated. The setup was amazing, everything is interactive and educational. There is also a great collection about indigenous people which are all so inspiring. But, of course the best of all, the natural history of BC.

A well curated museum.A must visit when in Victoria.
Right now though only the nature history wing is open and tickets as low as  $5 is being charged.

Will like to visit when the renovations are over to look at the rest of their fabulous collections.

It was a bit hard to find the street entrance when following Google maps so we accidentally went up the wrong way and found ourselves in someone's yard. That was awkward.

We could have rented a car and planned our own exploration of trails near Victoria. But booking the Rainforest Tour was a great decision. We didn't need a car for the rest of our trip, so it would be an unnecessary expense and hassle. It was also much nicer to have someone drive us! Plus, Toni knew the best places to stop for a break and snack en route and the best trails to see. The experience was made simpler and stress-free by booking the tour. All we had to do was arrive at the pick up spot (Tourist Information booth at the Harbour) and enjoy the day. A key feature for us was that it was a small group (max 6 people).

Mystic Beach was an enjoyable destination. The trail is a good balance between nature walk and hike. There are areas where you have to mind your footing, so it is best to wear good shoes or even hiking boots. I wore good walking shoes and was fine. If you are not an experienced hiker, it should be no problem; just take your time and you'll be fine. This is a great day trip for all skill levels.

There was a heat wave the week we did the tour. It was ok in the trails: the tree canopy and ocean breeze created a very comfortable experience.

Next time we are in Victoria we will book again to see the old growth forests in the Northern Juan de Fuca trails.


Gorgeous day hike outside of Victoria in a section of the Juan de Fuca trail. A fun experience that included a suspension bridge, beach waterfall, tide pools, and unique rock formations. Toni is a fun knowledgeable guide who absolutely loves her job and the area. Lunch was great ‚Äì the gluten chicken sandwich was delicious. Highly recommend getting a baked good when lunch is picked up. Worth the time and effort ‚Äì would definitely go on a hike with Rainforest Tours again!


I had a wonderful time doing the East Sooke Regional Park - Aylard farm.  The views were breathtaking and well worth the time and money.  Toni was a great guide & hike compagnon!


Was lucky enough to do a full day tour with Toni in East Sooke park!

It was just 2 of us with Toni and she was amazing. Having recently recovered from injury, Toni was attentive to my needs and provided lots of breaks (filled with nature facts) and the best lunch spots! She was well prepared with lunch, ponchos and extra gear if needed! Being safety conscious I was very happy to see she had a full ‚Äútrip binder‚Äù of maps and evacuation points if anyone was injuries, as well as an extensive first aid kit! We were able to go to two different locations because we finished our loop early.

I really appreciate Toni‚Äôs flexible planning and extensive knowledge of the routes she leads you on. She truly knows the land and has watched it evolve through the years, and it‚Äôs fascinating to hear what has changed through the years. This is my first guided hike, and now that I‚Äôve seen how great a local guide is, I can not be going back! I will absolutely be doing more of Toni‚Äôs hikes the next time I‚Äôm in the area, and I can‚Äôt recommend her enough!

Fisherman's Wharf is located on the south west side of Inner Harbour, it offers food kiosks, unique shops and many eco-tour adventures ranging from whale watching, kayaking, pirate adventures, sport fishing and harbour ferries in a working harbour setting.

Be warned: there is a lot of water fowl poop in some areas, so look before you sit!


One of the best parks here in Victoria. The best for joggers and cyclists. The Beacon Hill Children' s farm in here is a major attraction for kids and adults with a petting zoo. This beautiful park is full of majestic dancing peacocks , Goose's and Ducks and tonnes of Herons


Amazing sight to behold here. The peacocks,  Canadian geese, and cranes fill the air with noise. The pathways and restroom facility are well maintained.

There is a gnarly Arbutus tree right next to it, and a fantastic view! See if you can find it! I have a YouTube channel; in the next couple of weeks I'm going to post a video that will show you how to get to that park bench! Check out my channel and subscribe so you don't miss it!

The Gate of Harmonious Interest marks the entryway to Canada's oldest Chinatown. Built in 1981 as an effort to preserve the Chinatown heritage. It was modelled after both the gateway of the Dunhuang Caves in China and the gate of Pingshan Hall in China. The roof is covered with golden glazed tiles, and decorated with Chinese supernatural creatures on the corner ridges.

Very nice Chinatown, clean, compact and felt safe unlike here in Seattle. The restaurants looked amazing and I will be back to try them. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom!


Not sure what's the hype about China Town. It's all beautiful architecture and lights. Most of the shops were closed on weekend and we corks hardly find any place to eat.

The breakwater has long been a favorite place of mine. An easy walk of about 5-10 minutes will take you to the light beacon and end of the breakwater. Has great views of the harbour and the ocean front. Sometimes when cruise ships are in port it can be very busy. On windy days you are quite exposed to the wind and possibly ocean spray.  Historically there were no fencing on the breakwater but now they have railings along the top on both sides. At a few points, you can go down stairs to access the lower breakwater. The lower break water can be difficult to walk on as it is just large rectangular stones that can be uneven. The lower breakwater is often where divers scuba dive and people fish.

This is a relatively small castle. However, I spent almost 2 hours there! The staff and volunteers are super nice and helpful! They also show that they do care about the castle! If you have any questions, ask them! They gave me a lot of information outside the brochure!

The restoration work is an ongoing process, so some of the rooms are not fully restored. I guess I could come back for a second visit after a few years!


This castle was amazing! Located in a neighborhood but had lots of parking! The inside was amazing!  The history preserved done excellent üëå the staff were very helpful and knowledgeable...they are currently working on restoring the original kitchen but worth the trip...masks are mandatory...

The place is an amazing piece architecture, with such deep history. Definitely a must visit if your looking for something to do.


The castle is a national historic site in Victoria, built as a Victorian-era mansion. You can simply come to view the outside architecture or you can take the tour inside. Definitely worth seeing if you like to see architecture that was surely ahead of it's time considering it was built in 1890!

Bug / Gift shop is free to enter. A lot of fun toys and gifts are available for decent prices. The actual paid access has some really cool insects and bugs on display if you can stomach it. Great for kids to see, touch (yes I said touch) and learn about. The facilitators are energetic and enjoy sharing their knowledge. Parents - this is legit a 20 - 40 min visit though. Plan accordingly. Overall - fun atmosphere for kids to learn about bugs and insects.


Visited this hidden gem recently and was amazed by the quality engaged educators, service, and family fun this place offers!

We were allowed to hold stick bugs, millipedes, horney devils, touch beetles and more. The content was age appropriate and entertaining.

We witnessed a rare sight when a cockroach was seen giving live birth. Right next to another one that was freshly molted.

The ant display was neatly organized along the walls. They had spiders and praying mantis.

A good place to bring your children. It's a small (mini) zoo but they can spend time reading and learning.


An awesome place to go if you're a lover of entomology, and regardless of whether you're a little kid, or a senior citizen, or a college student, or whatever, it's very welcoming.

The folks working there are really nice - the tour guide was informative and clearly cared a lot about their bugs, and the bugs themselves all seem to be doing well :)


What a great place to visit with or without kids. Our group - 6 adults enjoyed our experience very much. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome and once we were ready we were taken to another room with all the creapy crawlies. At the time they had 2 lovely ladies explaining and answering any and all questions from visitors. Both ladies loved what they did as they talked with such love and passion for the animals which made me very comfortable being around spiders and other crawly critters. I would definitely recommend the Bug Zoo!

Hands down the absolute best observatory I‚Äôve been to all day. Will return for more sunrise-watching soon. Best wishes to all the dog walkers with their cute dogs. Walking your dog brings joy to so many people.


Great views of Victoria from the Observatory‚Ä¶..nearly 360 degrees. Observatory is not open to the public, but there are several benches to enjoy the view. Dog friendly.


Not sure if this place is still in operation but the views are amazing from here. Little parking lot just a short walk to the observatory. There is construction going on in the area, be aware of the blast horn and the explosion afterwards. There was another couple there and they looked concerned but we explained to them what just happened as you can feel it through the ground hundreds of feet away. We really enjoyed the day here, would love to come at night to see if this place come alive.


Awesome views of the coast and very easy access, at least from the back. A bit more challenging up the slope from the front but there is a handrail on the steepest section. There are stairs and a rocky path up. Just be careful especially if wet or in poorly lit conditions.

They took us ahead of our scheduled time.  We scheduled an extended tour of the area.  It was a very quiet and enjoyable ride.  Since it was late in the day, toward the end of the tour, we requested an early drop-off at the ship, and they accommodated our request.  Our guide was outstanding and gave insights into the local culture.  Our tour horse, Sampson, had a pleasant personality.  We would do this tour again.


We had the best time this past week with our Tally-Ho horse and carriage ride. We were extremely lucky to have Anna and Maggie as our tour guides. They were both very knowledgeable about the area. Maggie knew her route and seemed to really want to get up and go, she appeared to enjoy working. Anna kept both of my young children entertained with her history lessons and horse knowledge. I would recommend Tally-Ho for anyone looking for something to do in Victoria.


We did the 45 min Beacon Hill Tour on Oct 18, 2022. 4 adults fit comfortably in the carriage. Sampson (our horse) and Tyler ( or guide) were both amazing. Tyler answered all our questions about Sampson and had interesting facts about the areas we went past such as history of house paint colours and some fun facts about Emily Carr.  He had a great sense of humour and I must admit, I enjoyed when he pointed out a squirrel with ""an especially fluffy tail.""
Heads up for guests, there are 2 carriage companies across from each other on the corners and they seem to alternate corners so make sure you read the sign on the podium.
My one piece of feedback for the company would be getting the guides some kind of portable microphone to make it easier to hear the guides.
For any one concerned about the horse's welfare, you can tell the love the company and guides have for them. They do track air quality and cancel accordingly. Tyler was able to tell us so much about Sampson's personality, such as his favourite length of tour (45-60 mins).


We took the Saanich Cider tour. We had a wonderful afternoon.  Anna and Maggie were wonderful hosts.  From our starting coffee at Fresh cup, through our country jaunt to Sea Cider (lovely tasting of 12 different ciders), our box lunch by Truffles catering, which rivalled any ‚ÄúHigh Tea‚Äù we have had in Victoria, each component of the experience was memorable.  Thank you Tally-Ho!


Best tour, sweetest driver (wish I could remember her name)! So accommodating and got us in right at sunset. Horses are very well cared for and have a good relationship with their driver.

Beautiful view. Must see at dark! We walked down below beside the main walkway. Be prepared to get soaked!! Especially after the first set of stairs up to the main walkway. It was such a fun experience though! :)


Now this is a pretty walk. Enjoy the sunset or simply try and spot a seal. Perfect for viewing cruise ships. Great place to snap shots of the mountains and ocean.


One of our ports during our Alaska cruise. We arrived at 5pm, walked around the pier and then took a bus tour. Very nice place to walk and we were hitting sunset so the views were great!!!


A lovely walkway that offers spectacular views of the ocean and the opportunity to see the busy harbour traffic consisting of cruise ships, ferries, sailboats, helicopters, and more. You might also see seals, otters, and other sea creatures.

The three course afternoon tea with a pot of tea of your choice is $54. Very tasty and beautifully presented.

Friendly service, lovely setting. Be warned there are lots of annoying wasps on the terrace that swarm the tea tray even with a napkin draped over the tiers. There is indoor seating available as well.

Restroom/washroom inside by hostess stand and next to the gift store.


Had tea and a walk in the garden. Tea was pleasant and tasty. Not the fancy high end atmosphere of other places in town but more choices than some places including elevenses selection. Garden has some interesting specimens and a couple of amazing huge peonies. You can buy some plants here as well.


We went here for my birthday to experience the high tea, I reserved ahead of time and we got a beautiful seat by the window with a view.

The food was delicious and the tea perfect! If you go to the tea house I highly recommend the Royal Abkhazi High Tea! It consists of 4 courses and the herbal tea I had was Angelwater.

The Gardens were stunning! With beautiful assortments of flowers and alot of history the volunteers told us so much about this beautiful place.

I highly recommend checking out this place, the food is amazing and the gardens (especially at this time of year) are beautiful and blooming.


Abkhazi is Vancouver Island's secret garden. It is an absolutely beautiful garden that boasts huge old rhododendrons that are artfully placed throughout. Granite outcroppings dictate the shape of the surrounding garden beds. It is the jewel of the island. An added bonus is the quaint tea shop that serves high tea in China cups. There's no entrance fee, but they appreciate donations.


Beautiful gardens, a truly lovely setting.   High tea was tasty with generous servings.   The afternoon was hot and sunny with only 3 fans to keep the room cool.   It was hot inside.  4 stars instead of 5 for lack of cooling.

Went by to see the lights that were put up for Christmas, and was somewhat underwhelmed. While there are some gorgeous displays, I think the display could have been choreographed much better. There was no flow to these decorations. Next year they should higher an artist to plan it for them.

A fantastically historical spot. Beautiful and a great spot to admire the beautiful area. If you've never been under this bridge, do yourself a favor and visit. Read the signs, they have a great story to tell.


Beautiful spot for a break, or for a walk. The Tillicum Narrows, known as the Canal of Camosack back in the 1800‚Äôs is located on the Gorge Waterway in Victoria, BC, Canada. Reversing rapids are caused by the narrow pinch point at Tillicum Narrows where a large amount of tidal water is forced through the narrow passage. Currents have been known to reach up to 9 knots (17km/h) here. The tides caused by the moon make massive amounts of water move up and down the gorge and this unique feature makes for white water rapids, waterfalls or a surging channel depending on the water height. A bridge was built here due to the narrow crossing. The current bridge is the seventh incarnation.


Picture was taken when the tide was receding down to .29m. The roar of the water was louder than the traffic above on the bridge.


Interesting spot, especially the views of the bridge and the water flow.

The artists who make these sets are incredibly talented and have to be tremendously patient to be able to make scenes with such meticulous attention to detail. I particularly enjoyed the scenes of history‚Äôs great wars and the history of Canada‚Äôs western development. Absolutely a great way to spend an hour or so. Worth every penny.


Very interesting exhibits, I was very impressed with the detail in the miniature people, especially the really small ones. It was quite busy and hard to navigate and see everything. Kids will have loads of fun, but what helps them engage is the buttons they can push to make something move or light up. The only thing that did bother me was how dusty things were, but seeing that places like this have just reopened and may be having staff shortages due to the pandemic I'll definitely give them a break.


This place is so freaking cool. I thought it was maybe going to be a tourist trap but I'm so glad I went in. I can't even imagine the amount of work it must've taken to craft all these miniature scenes. Incredible amount of detail and so fun to look at. I loved that it was interactive with buttons to make things move and light up! If you're on the fence about visiting, do it!


I brought my children here and they were fascinated with all the detail and how they could see inside many buildings. The displays are brought to life with trains that move or figurines doing light action sequences. The interactive buttons to press for noises or commentary are a nice touch as well. Staff were very courteous and helpful. It's great to see that this place is still available for us inquisitive adults and the little ones in our lives. We will be back next year.


This place is great! Price is fairly affordable, and the detail in these dioramas is insane! If you don't care for details, you might blow through this place pretty quickly. But if you take your time to look at all the intricate details you can easily spend an hour or more here. Some of the displays have interactive buttons that make things happen on the diorama itself which is pretty cool. I think the only thing that would be cool is if they had some modern-day dioramas as well as all the old historic stuff.

The beautiful setting and the serendipitous meeting only occurred because the park was so beautifully maintained and the city took time to create this opportunity by leaving the piano out.

Beautiful beach. Came here during our vacation, the place has amazing spots for picture, a little park for kids to place, and nice waters for a quick swim. Only problem is, there is an insane amount of rocks in the water. I bled a little when it cut my foot.. so i would be careful where you step. Otherwise, the water isn't too deep, not too cold either. This is definitely a place that deserves to be called a beach. üëè

Beautiful place to roam and see the sun set. It is soooo comforting and the air is so fresh here.


The beaches along Dallas road abundant and well-kept.

There are wide pathways for pedestrians, and marked cycling paths as well that are newly installed.

The pond by this beach is nice, but often infested with geese droppings, and such becomes a bit inaccessible.

Lovely pedestrian, biking only bridge crossing the gorge. Connects the boardwalk around Glo restaurant on the north and the Galloping Gpose Trail to the South. Beautiful views all around. Be careful of the bike traffic as they travel very quickly over the bridge.


Updated posting:
Added a couple of photos looking at the north shore of the Gorge in the area. A developer has asked for a rezoning to demolish and rebuild with more floors the units along the shore. I think the taller buildings detract from the beauty of the shoreline and I hope it gets turned down.

Odd watercraft today ‚Ä¶ looked like a cross between a hovercraft and a crane. And sounded like one as well. Didn‚Äôt see anything particularly interesting being pulled up. Maybe a barge crane has too much of a draft for the area. It isn‚Äôt very deep. Still ‚Ä¶ why?


This bridge is very sturdy. I have crossed it hundreds of times and it has never collapsed. It does an excellent job of getting you between Gorge-Burnside and Vic West ‚Äî much more convenient than swimming across the Selkirk Waterway (or walking to Bay Street or Tillicum Road to use one of those bridges). The bridge boasts great views of the inner harbour and Gorge Waterway because it is right in the middle of them.

Built: 1885

ARCHITECTURE:
2 storey Italian
Known for many years as the Dingle House Restaurant, it was attributed to John Teague, although there is no evidence that he was the architect. It was built for Charles William and Matilda Ringler Thomson, who lived in it until their death in 1916. Charles, or ‚ÄúGasworks Thomson‚Äù as he was affectionately called, was born in London, England, in 1827. He left in 1859 for the Gold Rush in California, ended up on Vancouver Island and became a mule trader, supplying pack animals in the Cariboo. In 1860, Charles married Matilda Midwinter in San Francisco. Matilda was born in Kent, England, in 1823. The couple came to Victoria and Charles became secretary and eventually manager of the newly formed Victoria Gas Co (502 Pembroke St., Burnside). He also had other interests, including real estate and finance, becoming a partner in BC Loan Co. Charles and Matilda succumbed to bronchitis during the bitterly cold winter of 1916. The $1 million estate went to Charles' sister, Janet Ringler Thomson, who left the house empty for nearly two years.

The absolute worst way to spend $21.00. It would have been more entertaining flushing my money down the toilet than visiting this museum. It consists of 2 small rooms, smaller than my bedroom. Very over-priced, left a lot to be desired. Needs improvement. After 5 minutes you have seen all there is to see. Don't waste your money.


We had such fun at the Sea Glass Jewelry class!  Naomi was a wonderful, patient and enthusiastic teacher. Bonus was that a visit to the museum was included in the modest fee!


Kinda sad really.
There's a room, maybe 150 sq ft with some models of ships ( really nice models, very detailed some 4' long ).
Maybe 10 or 12 ships.
There's another room with some examples of knots sailers use.
There's a box with 1 side gravel and 1 side sand and some miniature examples of various types of anchors you can put in the gravel / sand and see how they grab the bottom.
That's about it.
$10.00 admission, we looked around and read the little info cards on the model ships and were out in about 20 minutes.
I was totally underwhelmed and disappointed. You'd think we could do better.


As the other reviews have said... Very small. If the fee was maybe cheaper, it would be ok (and maybe attract more customers). Only went in for the Saturday themed playgroup which was good... If I paid just for the museum, it's not ok..

There is a suggested donation, I barely remember how much it is. But I donated around 15 dollars for four, I think.

They have different farm animals. The goats were the star of the farm. You can't really pet them because of COVID. But a staff would walk around to let you touch the goat.

The peacocks of course were so cute.


My 1.5 year old son and wife LOVED this place! We arrived to Victoria via cruise ship and had a day to explore. This farm was our first stop. It‚Äôs surrounded by a beautiful park and the animals were very social and seemed happy. Staff were around to keep an eye on families and pick up goat poop which was very much appreciated. There are wash stations in between animal areas and the farm was quite clean and well kept. Overall we had a blast and would recommend a pit stop here via pedicab to get the most scenic route!


My kids spent at least an hour in the goat pen and it was an effort to get them to move on. It was the highlight for sure. I liked the board with all the lineages, and finding which babies belonged to which mamas. It was very sweet how often we found even older siblings resting together. We had no idea what to expect for the morning goat stampede but it was quite entertaining in it‚Äôs own way!

The goat pen is the tidiest one I have ever been in for this type of thing. Staff very actively cleaning up droppings and adding clean wood shavings. Quite impressive to be honest, I‚Äôm used to dodging poop whenever we‚Äôve been at similar goat/animal petting areas.

Otherwise, my kids liked the chickens and the peacocks, especially when one peacock inside the farm was trying to intimidate another one outside.

Suggested donation is $4/kid and $5/adult. Masks are required for the goat stampede and in the goat pen.


Easily the highlight of our visit to Victoria. They have lots of pigs, flightless birds (including a peacock) and about 60 goats you can go and pet, which is really fun and I'd recommend it to people of all ages (I'm 32 and I loved it)

Read the story of Peanut Butter which was beautiful and heart breaking. It's clear the staff here love their work and their animal friends. A small donation of 5 dollars is optional but customary! The entire place is run on donations!


The Beacon Hill Children's Farm is a wonderful place for all ages to visit! If you can, try to catch the running of the goats - an adorable tiny stampede.

Please keep in mind that the pathways are accessible, but may be difficult for wheelchair users. If you have mobility issues, please keep in mind that there are no accessible washrooms near the farm - you have to go over to the playground area.

The jeans i was looking for (and it said were in stock online at this location) only had size 00 & 20 - basic black skinny jean. Not one of the staff offered help, walked past me a few times.

Previously, I brought my teen son in, and no one helped us on the floor or at the change rooms with sizes - or asked how my son was doing in the change room. I emailed the store & never heard back.


Awesome store! Starts with a warm welcome at the door and the specials/deals. Cashier was friendly and patient as I looked for my coupons and credit card in my huge purse and a long line behind me. Every employee here I've come across was courteous and helpful.


I shop here because I have to, its one of the few places anyone over the size of 14 can shop. The prices are incredibly expensive for the fast fashion they area, and you are at a whim to whats in style. I wish they sold more basics that didn't come pre-ripped.

The store manager was very rude and didn't appreciate us browsing for clothes. Kept asking us to collect the hangers after we tried on clothes. You have store associates to help sort clothes, don't expect customers to go picking up hangers. She needs basic training on talking to customers. It was on a Monday at 3pm.


I will start off by saying, I get crazy anxiety when I have to go pants shopping-I avoid it at all costs unless I absolutely need to. It was one of those times yesterday and I was dreading a trip to the mall. I had gone into several stores and none of them had quite what I was looking for, and I was starting to get overwhelmed. I‚Äôve gotten nice professional pants from Reitmans before so I decided to stop in as my last effort before I gave up. They had exactly what I was looking for! Best of all, there wasn‚Äôt a crazy hassle to get into the change rooms, the staff were super friendly and easygoing. Often times when shopping in retail stores I feel like an inconvenience to the workers but this was not the case at all here! I even worked up the courage to ask them if they had the pair I was buying in a different colour in my size, and while they didn‚Äôt have it in store they offered to order me a pair and have it shipped right to me!! I left feeling more than happy with my shopping trip. Thank you to the lovely staff who helped me have such a comfortable experience :)


I wear Plus Size clothing - a size range that is becoming harder and harder to find as stores close out and change their clothing focus to smaller sizes. I was trying to find a top to wear to my mother's Celebration of Life in 3 days. I did a quick round of the store and picked a half dozen different possibilities that I needed to try on. I don't buy clothing on-line as finding the right fit is very challenging and I don't buy anything without trying it on first. I was heading towards the fitting rooms only to be told in a snippy manner that the Fitting Rooms were closed as it was nearing the end of the day and they needed to be cleaned. It was 25 minutes before the closing time. There was one other customer in the store. Ummm....in a time where brick and mortar stores are shutting down because of lack of sales in person and people shifting to on-line purchases, this is pathetic customer service. Reitmans was once a great place to shop for Plus Size clothing but the experience that I've had at this location means I will never step foot in this store again!


I had poor customer service this evening when trying to return an item. The woman was very condescending to my request when a little empathy would have gone a long way. I understand there are policies and procedures, but you don't need to be rude about it.


I walked into this store today (Monday). It was quiet. There were 3 associates talking to each other.  None of them were greeting any of the customers including myself, that were walking into the store. I Stayed in the store, for at least 30 minutes. One of the Associates came  beside me to sort out the racks. She still did‚Äôt acknowledge my presence as a customer.

Then, I when went to one of the Associates  to check out the price of all of the items.  She was not very friendly at all.

The salesperson #888888 who processed my items was friendly but still, this store needs to train their associates to be more Customer focused.

Love this store so much. It was my first time going into this store today, but they have great quality clothes,  affordable pricing and what‚Äôs  more, super nice and helpful staffs! Although it was extremely busy there while I was trying, staffs are really helpful to give me advise about the style and the size. I was not sure which size to try so I got  lots items in wrong sizes, but the staff checked in with me while I was in fitting room, and got all correct sizes for me immediately. I am so impressed by their customer service. Sometimes I feel some boutiques are kinda pushy or not helpful at all, but at this store, I felt staffs are truly kind and helpful. I definitely recommend this store.


I love their selection, the styles were all me!  Sometimes difficult to find a particular size because they don‚Äôt overbuy.  Staff was very helpful and attentive.


The clothes here are beautiful, good quality and fairly priced. The main reason for the glowing review is the costumer service, the manager went above and beyond for me after I found an issue with one piece I bought. Definitely turned me into a repeat customer.


I shopped at Spank on Saturday to find a dress to wear to an upcoming wedding. Although the store had many options, I left before I had tried them all on due to the rude, fat-shaming nature of the employee working the change room. When my mother commented that she didn't like one of the dresses I tried on, the change room employee agreed saying ""I was going to say, you look a bit heavy...""  Afterwards, I was trying on a dress and the employee insisted I try it in another colour. Through the door I could hear her calling to her coworker across the store to find the other dress saying repeatedly ""No, she needs a size large. A large! She needs a large!!""  She had not asked me what size I needed, just assumed, and I had to correct her through the door, saying ""No I am a medium."" These comments made me uncomfortable and self-conscious. Even if she didn't have ill-intent I think it is undeniable that this behaviour is inexcusable and unacceptable, especially by a complete stranger when someone is in the vulnerable state of trying on clothes (I did not ask for her opinion in the first place lol). I am not an overweight person and I am finally confident and happy with my body after years of struggle, yet this employee made me feel extremely insecure by her use of the word 'heavy', assumptions about what size I wear and the shouting of that size across the store. I worry about how someone who is plus-size or struggling with body image issues or an eating disorder would feel after an encounter with this employee. So disappointing.

I was truly disappointed when I went to take back some clothing I had purchased for my 86 year old mom. Before she could try them on (she's in a wheelchair) she ended up in hospital. Post going home I became ill and couldn't go to see her to assist with trying on clothing. I called the store just before 30 day refund notice was due *as I wouldn't be able to make the deadline. The clerk said no problem - they would work it out if it was only a few days. I went in 8 days late and was told no refund at all. Just store credit. There was zero compassion or empathy. just kept my money and issued me a gift card for the amount - over $200. My mom can't shop there as their clothing doesn't work for her - except for 2 pairs of pull up pants.
I will not be recommending Penningtons to anyone. The service was cold and uncaring.


I give the Victoria Pennington's location a full 5 stars for their consistent, excellent customer service.  I've shopped here for many years, and the ladies who work here are always friendly and very helpful. My visit yesterday was no exception... top-notch service!

The last time I was here, the salesgirl embarrassed me. She did help me, as I was having trouble finding certain things in my size, but at the cash register she loudly asked what size I had chosen to get. I was embarrassed because there were strangers in earshot and I was buying highly personal things.

You'd think someone working in a plus-size store would realize that sizes would be a touchy subject. She could have just asked, ""Did you find what you needed?"" That would have been more discreet.

Thank you so much.


How have I waited this long to write a review for Smoking Lily?? This is my favorite shop in all of Victoria. They make small batches of screen printed clothing so everything you buy is incredibly unique and there is really no way you'll see anyone else wearing your adorable tunic dress (that has pockets!) or your amazing bee and flowers skirt around town. I have purchased several dresses, skirts, scarves, etc. from Smoking Lily and they are the go-to staples in my wardrobe. Cannot tell you how many compliments I have received and people asking where I get my clothes from. They also carry beautiful pottery and jewelry from local artists. The staff is wonderful, caring, and very helpful! They are always wearing Smoking Lily pieces so it's easy to get inspiration for outfits. I'm seeing some other reviews about their clothes being pricey... but you're paying for high quality fabric (amazingly soft cotton, stretchy linen, etc.), beautiful prints, and the uniqueness of their pieces.


If you're visiting Victoria this store is a must for one of a kind finds. If you're a local, this is the place for zero waste, comfortable, flattering clothing and accessories. Locally made from start to finish, and such beautiful designs and prints. Don't miss it!


Great service and I love that the clothes are made locally. They use high quality fabrics that are so comfortable!


Adore this shop. Screen printed tees have great whimsical designs. You'll get plenty of compliments from people when you wear something from this shop.

All of the staff were absolutely brilliant, but Victoria went out of her way to make my experience (and my friend's) feel comfortable, beautiful, and heard - no matter your size.  Excellent all around and I will definitely be back!


Me and my friend visited the Laura uptown yesterday,  we were searching for something really particular,  Samin helped us to find the perfect outfit for me and my friend. She was really professional,  friendly and kind. She always had her beautiful smile in her face eventhough we giving her so many questions.  Thank you so much Samin for all your help and advice.  And really appreciate LAURA CANADA for there amazing employees üëè


The staff are super friendly and were very helpful in finding me a prom dress that would suit my body type!
Thanks again!


I went in to try a dress in the Uptown mall which I saw online for 222 on sale. The staff said she would order it to the store for me no need to order online.

2 weeks later I get a call ""Sorry this dress is now sold out."" I should have just ordered online from the start and not have taken her advice. Just unbelievable. I needed the outfit for a xmas party.


I love the flexibility of booking a private shopping appointment. I did this in September and with Shannon's expertise and knowledge I was able to put together my Fall wardrobe without any stress. Shannon made the whole experience FUN!! I get so many compliments when I wear the clothes she picked for me. I highly recommend you book an appointment!
A month later I went back for my winter coat and again Shannon helped me out. From now on I'm just going to let her pick all my clothes....LOL!!

very friendly staff.  I love the bamboo fabric!  They are the only store I have ever seen with bamboo prints!  I always find lots of dresses & tops when I go in or when I order on-line!


Thank you to Blue Sky for such a positive experience. When the sale item I ordered online could not be shipped as stock had run out, I received a telephone call offering to substitute a similar sale item, more expensive, at the same price. That item was then shipped immediately. A very positive customer experience.


Lovely selection. Beautiful and comfortable clothing. Staff were so gracious and professional


The ladies in the shop always take great care of you and the store generally has an uplifting atmosphere.  I was recently in to exchange some items and even though they weren't making much money from me i felt valued as a customer. I appreciate that! Their clothes really look great on my curvy figure and so comfortable. Best tights ever!

Knocking extremely loudly on me in the fitting room (without saying a single word) so much that you startle me just to ""check if someone is there"", is not only unprofessional but completely senseless. You could have just asked, gently knocked and followed it by a question, or looked at the bottom of the door to check if the room is occupied (the doors do not reach till the floor and you could easily see people's feet). Even the customer in the room next to me was scared from how aggressive it was. I also agree with the previous comments, there was at least 4 staff working and no one checked in at all (despite there being only a couple other customers).


More than 50% of their lights were off. Adjacent stores no issue with lights. When I asked staff why more than 50% of their lights were off, they offered no explanation. It was dark, difficult to the see fashions and a very poor shopping experience. Why bother to have the doors open. Turn off all the lights
and you can save even more money on electricity and staff with customers.


Awesome customer services..As i love to do window shopping so whenever I go to uptown I usually go in suzy too‚Ä¶They generally have various varieties of different outfits‚Ä¶however,there is a person named Snehjeet, She always have a smile on her face and help in finding the best suitable clothes for me.

This is the sweetest little shop ever.

She was so so so patient while I ran back and forth to baby.. there‚Äôs so many cute things you could look and sniff for hours! I would have stayed the whole day with Margo, she was the best part about Amelia Lee !!!!


The over $200 purse I JUST bought from this store broke. It‚Äôs a large purse, I assumed it was strong enough to carry an iPhone, an iPhone charged me and small wallet and a key fob but I was wrong. The strap tore right off, my belongings went flying and now my phone is cracked and I can‚Äôt see the screen. I was told this bag was of good quality by the sales associate, she even said it was durable. I‚Äôm now out $200 and a less then a year old iPhone. Thanks !


I don‚Äôt really understand this store. I mean I get what they are going for, love the concept of combining fashion, lifestyle and motherhood. They have a bit of everything but not enough of anything which would make me want to stop by to search for something. Honestly, local supplies are great I‚Äôm all for shopping local/ but every store within and in the proximity of the downtown core carries the exact same stuff, hires the same people to collaborates on something ‚Äúunique‚Äù, differentiates themselves by the little oddities they sell which actually are also sold down the street, located in funky heritage buildings, which really are in not in areas easily accessible for moms or children, probably not in well cared for buildings, do not cater to tourists whatsoever despite being in the tourist hub, and are all in all crummy areas in the city, try something new! Of the non local brands carried- plenty and evey store probably on lojo carry them too. A piece or two atleast. There‚Äôs a reason this city is known as the place where fashion doesn‚Äôt exist.


I was surprised to see the boutique had relocated from Johnson St but this new location is excellent. I found a lovely sweater and blouse that are excellent wardrobe staples.

On more than one occasion I have stood in line on my lunch break to purchase things and have ended up leaving because the amount of time it takes them to serve one person is INSANE. I have never seen lazier or slower moving employees in my life. Today, after I finally got up to the counter, got acknowledged by the employee as wanting to pay, then he turned around and him and the other 3 employees stood leaning on the counter watching a security guard follow a shoplifter for a while, until I had to interrupt and politely ask if I could pay for my items so I can get back to work. If that was the first time it‚Äôs be one thing, but it‚Äôs like this every time unfortunately and quite frankly, it‚Äôs very disrespectful of other peoples time. Will not be back, you shouldn‚Äôt have to beg employees to let you purchase something in a clothing store.


They have a very poor return policy. They won't provide a refund on anything, and for a large number of items they won't even give an in-store credit. Apparently this is written in small print on your receipt, which they hand you AFTER you have already made your purchase. Don't ever purchase anything from here unless you are absolutely, 100% certain that it is the right size, shape, colour, style, etc, of something that you are sure you want, because you will likely be stuck with it afterwards whether you change your mind or not. Or better yet, save yourself the worry and just go someplace else.


I went into the store wanting to trade in a piece that i got in a size too small. I didn‚Äôt receive a receipt upon my purchase because they had ran out of paper. I later came in trying to trade in this piece for a larger size and the manager asked me for information which is reasonable. I had to show proof of my purchase through a bank statement which takes a while but she had rushed me and told me she was unwilling to look through purchases that I thought were the specific one. It was a lot unnecessary attitude that would‚Äôve all been avoided if the change rooms were being run and I didn‚Äôt have to wait a while to not even try on the clothing.


My experience if I could give it 0 I would, the staff was no where to be found the whole time I was there. The store was not clean either. When I was checking out the lady in the photo was being extremely mean to the girl she was training. Was also being extremely rude to me and my friends when we were confused about something. I had, had enough so I told her she didn‚Äôt need to be so rude she laughed at me. I told the girl in training that she was super nice and was doing an amazing job and to have a nice day. As I was leaving the lady in the photo called me a ‚Äústupid c*nt‚Äù I had turned back and said that was not appropriate in a work place and I asked for her name and she wouldn‚Äôt give it to me so I took this photo she called me a bunch of other names I really don‚Äôt think that is appropriate for a work place I will not be coming back horrible experience I felt attacked


Megan was extremely helpful during our visit today. We were trying to return an item from Urban Behaviour, and although she originally said we could not, she still wanted to confirm with her manager. He said we couldn‚Äôt, so she proceeded to assist us in finding other locations where we could make the return.

In the meantime, her manager called back after speaking to the district manager, and informed her she could in fact accept our return and give store credit.

Overall, she was helpful, patient, and a good customer service representative.

Really enjoyed my shopping experience with her.  I really respect her professionalism and really appreciate her kindness.


I went into this store browsing dresses for a somewhat last minute upcoming event, the staff greeted me with smiles and noticed I seemed defeated after a long search for dresses. They put their utmost effort in searching through the whole store and online for something that may work for my body type. Though I didn't find something at this location, they were all able to guide me to another store where I did! Thank you so so much! Your help made the search much easier!

Huge thank you to Joanne with an E. Back in March you helped me dress my bestie who was visiting. My Jo-Ann has an hourglass figure. Vavavavoom! Joanne found the perfect dress ! Had a beautiful selection! Was hard to decide. She made my friend feel like a Queen. Lovely knickers to go underneath as well. Can‚Äôt thank you enough for the refreshing experience.


My friend and I were at the Mayfair Mall location in Victoria and she found a pair of pants. The sales lady sold her the pants but my friend realized that she had purchased the wrong size. The sales lady said that for inventory purposes they would have to do a return and then she could rebuy the pants. After a very painful process of doing the return, and my friend angry at how inconvenienced she was at having to wait for them to process this decided to just stick with the return of the pants. Glad you fixed your inventory situation but you lost a sale! We will not be back.

Greeted nicely every time I come in, clean organized store. Staff go above and beyond to see if they have a size I need if they don‚Äôt they show me similar styles, very helpful and kind.


Great prices for nice styles.
However customer service is lacking... people who work there don't engage with the customers... very robotic, only saying the sales and what is mandatory to say.


I'm completely disappointed in the customer service here today, usually I love this place and bringing my friends there and reccomending this as a one stop shop but after today I will no longer.

I don't reccomend coming here unless you are okay with final sales even if clothings damaged by staff and you don't mind constantly not being told anything is a final sale/exchange only. You won't know until it's too late so unfortunate that I now can't come here anymore without feeling uncomfortable :/


If I would have known I could write a review for this store earlier I would have.

I bought two items and realized I actually didn‚Äôt need the second pair of shorts because I already had them! I went to return them two seconds after buying them. The ‚Äúmanager‚Äù laughed in my face and told me she doesn‚Äôt do returns and that there‚Äôs nothing she could do. I told her she just did my purchase? I didn‚Äôt even walk out of the store yet.

I won‚Äôt shop here and I love sirens. I‚Äôve never been treated so poorly in any retail store. Quite confusing to why I was being treated so poorly?

Anyway, lost me and my husband as customers.

I rediscovered Verve last year and I couldn't be happier!  Since that time, I have loaded up on high quality cashmere sweaters, Louboutin boots, outfits for special events as well as cool jeans and jackets for day to day; all at 1/3 or less their retail value!!  The condition, quality and style is excellent!  Sometimes I go in just to get a Margot dose to brighten my day.  She is truly committed to helping her customers find their perfect items.  Margot will tell you if something doesn't work on you.  She has a great eye and  wants you to have no regrets when you get home.  I have told all my friends to go to Verve and they are now regulars as well!
Thanks Margot... super satisfied customer.


The clothes are in brand new condition yet the prices are so reasonable. I found a suit that looks like it was never worn and the price was so good I could not justify not buying it. Must say the store looks so much better now that the floors have been refinished! Friendly service, great prices, great clothes,,, shopping heaven!


Margot is phenomenal and her lovely shop carries a wide selection of well curated and highly stylish pieces. I thoroughly enjoy following her shop on Instagram (particularly Saturday‚Äôs when she posts entertaining videos with Monty the dog). I am always inspired by the fashion forward outfits she puts together.


Once you meet Margot, the owner of Verve, you will never want to shop anywhere else again!  She is your very own personal shopper and she knows her brands and has amazing style!

I've been to this location several times and always have a great experience! I've bought items from here a couple times and the staff have always been really helpful and friendly. The times I was just browsing the store the staff were great too. I knew they were there to help but not hovering, which is perfect. The store is always clean and they have great selection...such cute clothes! Wish I could buy everything in the store!!


Hit and miss with the Staff. I am a fairly regular customer and tonights service was below average. I had some of my items brought to the front desk while I continued to shop and when I went to pay for everything  she forgot to add them, I kindly reminded her that she forgot those items. I thought she ran all the items through, as there were only two items, a dress and a belt to match the dress. She didn't put the belt with the rest of the order, although it was clearly indicated both items were to be added to the order. Cashier: Sofi and/or Associate: Taylor M, not sure which one but I have seen her there a few times while I shop and who ever it was had a horribly snobby attitude while she was ringing everything through. There is no reason for the horrible service I received from that one employee. As a store that sells fairly nice and pricey clothing the attitude of your employees should match exactly that! Thanks, I will make an extra trip to get the belt and it should not have been missed in the order the first or second time, seems like intentionally rude behavior. I hope the owner of the store takes better care of their employees so this doesn't have to happen to any customer, especially a regular....shameful!  At least the new girl was amazingly nice and helpful, along with the other lady helping me with dress sizes. Sometimes it's really great service, but the end of that shopping experience left a bad impression on customer service and satisfaction.


Their selection has improved dramatically (for the better) over the last few years. It's an odd mix of brands carried rhough, you have $300+ quality denim brands and then poorly made $50+ sweaters that the store has carried forever for reasons I don't understand. The staff at this location make sure your never standing around with items your going to be trying on, if you have any questions they will most likely make it to you and ask if you need anything before you even realize you do.. that being said, (and not all of them) but quite a few of the girls are not exactly very polite, in fact some of them can be quite bluntly judgemental and give off a very unwelcoming and entitled (not sure to what) aura. It resulted in me associating the whole store with these negative interactions I experienced and have witnessed others experience as well,  It would be a much more satisfying experience if the employees who give off this impression be reminded that as employees they are meant to represent the company  and the brand's it carries, be that negative or positive it does reflect back onto the store.


The customer service is questionable at the uptown location. The staff wasn't helpful and when I asked about professional wear. She pointed to a region and said you can find them in that region but all I saw were jeans and casual clothing. I guess maybe it's not the place for professional wear. But the staff, she could have told me sorry, we don't sell anything like that. Her attitude was surprisingly ignorant. I will never go in there again and I definitely prefer Zara more.

In addition to the store design, I was taken back with the clothes selection and how it's tastefully organized on the rack and the shelves. Kudos to Natalie and Maria!

A new favourite! The owner Lindsey, is kind, friendly, and funny. You can tell she loves what she does. She has an amazing selection of gorgeous and unique clothes and accessories. A real pleasure to shop here.


Amazing selection of unique beautiful clothes that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else. Pants that actually fit my body and look flattering! That‚Äôs a first. A must visit. Super friendly warm service.

I staff were very helpful. I am a long term Talbots customer. My question is - what is going on with the quality of Talbots clothing? I have items in my closet  that I bought at Talbots years ago that I can still wear. The items I purchased in December 2021 will be relegated to gardening gear  by summer. Truly disappointed customer.


The staff are friendly and always ensure that I receive any discount that's possible even if it isn't in effect until the next day. Today I grabbed some sweaters.


The quality of items isn't the same as it used to be and there are a lot of flimsy tops and knitwear that just won't last.  I have things in my closet from Talbots that are 20 years old and still look great.  The quality has declined.  On my visit today the clerk was impatient and rude and the store wasn't busy.  I miss the ""old"" Talbots.


I love visiting this store when I visit Victoria.  The clothes are fashionable, flattering, comfortable, and very well made. The store has a lovely welcoming atmosphere.  When browsing, I couldn't help but smile at the banter taking place between the staff and the customers.  And when they have a sale it is like no other...talk about indulging in retail therapy!  Way to go for Talbots!


Shopped before Christmas, boxing week some items price are changed higher to discount. Won‚Äôt do price adjustment. You can return but they won‚Äôt sell you again. Unbelievable! Manager is very rude and unprofessional. A staff state ‚Äú She is the manager, there is nothing we can do about it‚Äù. Will never be back!

I shopped on a Saturday night from the comfort of my own home. The website images inspired me cuz the owner is the real deal of a woman. She models her own clothes! I was looking for two summer tunics and found what I was looking for along with what I hoped would be perfect leggings. I sensed I could trust the sizing and images presented. So I placed my order. Then a box with a hand-written label addressed to me arrived on Wednesday the following week. When I opened the box, I was delighted to see that my expectations were met. Beautiful garments! And wrapped with care and attention to detail. Thank you Bodacious for being who you present yourself to be -- a celebration of the feminine in all her wisdom, elegance & beauty! Excellent & efficient service. Supremely gorgeous clothing. Loving detail. I will shop again soon!

I came into the store to try on some jeans (something I dread) and I'm so happy that I was assisted by Philip! He was so knowledgeable and kind. He asked me what type of fit I was looking for and advised me on how different Levi's would stretch a size over time. I'm so happy be recommended sizing down in Levi's Wedgies (with 1% elastane) because they certainly did relax in the seat and thighs.
He recommended different styles and I ended up buying three pairs. I'm so happy with how they fit and was incredibly impressed with Philip's help and attention.
Next time I look for jeans, I will stop by Below The Belt first and peek in to see if Philip is working! A rockstar employee! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê


Horrible customer service. No greeting during the whole time in store. 2 associates just chatting to each other. When I asked questions, very minimal cold answers. Brands in store are nice but definitely not their staffs.


My first experience in this store today was an absolute 5 star experience, and all thanks to a staff member who definitely deserves recognition. Phillip greeted me quickly upon entering the store! He was very well dressed, kind, and approachable. He spent so much time helping me find the perfect pair of Levi's jeans and I honestly probably would have gotten overwhelmed and left without a purchase had he not helped me find exactly what I need.  He held up a conversation in a casual and comfortable way which had me feeling like I was shopping with a good friend and not just being helped by an employee. That is something that would have me coming back just to have that level of service.

If there's one thing we all can agree on it's that finding a perfect pair of jeans is like finding a needle in a haystack. Thanks to Phillips that became an easy and pleasant experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è

My husband & I have been shopping at Citizen for several years now. We love the high quality of the clothing and the personable, thoughtful service that Patrick provides. It's one of our favourite stores in Victoria.


I had a fabulous experience shopping at Citizen today! The owner took care of me, offered personalized help and expert advice.

I went around to a bunch of stores looking for menswear, but consistently ended up back at Outlooks for my entire look for the day (including belt, shoes, and shirt). A great curated selection of menswear with very helpful staff! Thanks John!


Top shelf. Quality. Selection. Service. Johns personalized attention to his clients needs and preferences.  Outstanding.  Highly recommend.


Absolutely wonderful experience! John helped me craft the most amazing suit for my wedding. It was my first time getting something tailored, and John made it a fun and collaborative experience. The end result was the most spectacular outfit I‚Äôve ever owned, beautifully arranged and perfectly fitted.

The whole team was extremely helpful every step of the way and made the whole process very approachable. Going to Outlooks was worth every penny! I‚Äôll definitely be back if I ever need another suit.

One Saturday afternoon, I popped in to Ricki's to return an online purchase.  I usually don't love going to stores these days finding it difficult to get help...often finding unengaged staff. This was not the case at Hillside.  Browsing, I was asked by two different employees if they could assist or start a change room for me.  Once I did try something on, the staff was super helpful and cheerful!  Regan at check out was great and completed my experience on a high note.

I have worked in this store as a sales associate and the managers were racist and impolite to me and other previous sales associate. Also, the whole store is  TRASH!
Do not waste your money.


I have been here a couple of times now and I always seem to find something. Could have had one more sales person so while one was helping the other could have watched the cash register. It seems a sale was missed and it upset the ONLY sales person. I felt quite sorry for the sales person.

Hi Jackie;
Thanks for the fast great service from you.
Just wanted you to know that I picked up my new sweater & jeans today & they both fit - & look perfect together! I wasn't worried about the sweater but I thought maybe the jeans wouldn't be right (maybe I'd changed & my old jeans were no longer the correct 4P?) But no, I slipped into these new jeans like butter & now, I just have to wash them to be 100% sure. They seem exactly right.


What a great shop!  My daughter and I broke out after 2 months of Isolation to visit our favourite clothing store.  We felt so comfortable with the precautions in place and the staff were just wonderful.  They even had their signature gumdrops individually packaged for customer treats.

You don't get that very often any more.


I enjoy shopping in Plenty women for myself and at Plenty Men for male members of my family.
This afternoon I went into the men‚Äôs store at Uptown Mall and noticed that 2 of the 3 male employees were wearing their masks below the nose.  We all know that it sucks that we are still having to wear masks, however we are still in the midst of a Pandemic and some people are doing their best to avoid getting sick.
I politely asked that the 2 guys wear their masks properly and they did so without a problem.  I feel that I should not have to ask, however.
The employees are a reflection of the integrity of the store management and if they are not wearing masks properly it speaks volumes about how much they do or don‚Äôt respect the public.  I felt you would want to know about this.
Other than this the service was great.

Thank you.


Men can get some snazzy clothing here and one stop shop for it too. Excellent prices and staff are helpful. Not to be missed.


I went there it was the best experience from a clothing store I‚Äôve been to designer shops and the people at Plenty blew them out the water for service and helping me choose clothes  10/10 I highly recommend going there. Also the building and the layout is very welcoming

Jeans smell of mothballs after a first rinse in water. Multiple washings have not removed the stench. The manager had not heard of that before and only offered an exchange instead of a refund, so BR does not accept responsibility for defective products. A brief internet search reveals this mothball issue is a real thing. Will not buy there again, and I feel sorry for others who end up with the same problem. In the store there is no hint of mothball smell, it manifests only after you get home


Terrible service...
I ordered a couple things online under final sale.. loved them but that sizes were wrong and either the local store or online were willing to help. Refused to change the sizes for me and / or do a store credit.... no matter if it was ""final sale"", online ordering should always be subject to either option as the sizes specially at Banana Republic are not consistent.

I guess lesson learned... I was a regular shopper and this situation will for sure affect my shopping with Banana Republic.


My experience at Banana Republic in the Mayfair Mall in Victoria today was less than pleasant. I was not properly greeted, no eye contact was made, and I felt shoved out of the way by staff and customers when i was trying to look at the merchandise. I won‚Äôt darken their doors again.


Staff were great, I wish the sizing wasn‚Äôt so short though, mens fit used to be much better. I‚Äôd guess the people writing negative comments about customer service are probably clueless that Covid has affected service staff levels‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure it was traumatic not getting greeted, must be tough spending daddy‚Äôs dirty money all day, everyday.

They are clearly looking for specific pieces or brands as they are so full, why not communicate what they are looking for.

This could be a wonderful little shop but seriously needs a vibe check.


I knew to expect higher prices since it‚Äôs consignment/curated but wow $20+ for a used plain black Gildan t-shirt is what to expect here. I guess those high prices can‚Äôt pay for an adequately sized cage for their two birds shoved into one very tiny cage together.

A few years ago I walked into pocket clothing with my partner and the lady who runs the store was very friendly and helpful. She sold me a pair of Louboutin high heels for $80 and assured me they were genuine. Along with it, I bought an Ecote handbag she told me was real Indian red leather. Turns out, years later when I went to inquire about my items, I was told they were fake. And the handbag was Urban Outfitters I believe. They were both fakes and I felt she took advantage of me and my partner being we were coming out of homelessness at the time. I mean, its one thing to make a sale and another to mislead a person into thinking they're buying something authentic when they're told so. Won't be returning, just to post this review to warn others.


Super cool place with great curation of alternative and fashionable options. I admire the window display everytime they change it - which is often! Seems I always want something in the window!!

A great find in Fan Tan alley!


I love everything about this hidden gem of a store! The clothing is beautiful, with so many different prints and lovely fabrics and the jewellery was very nice as well. Allan is awesome, gives great customer service, and his little shop has a great vibe. We will definitely be back soon, thank you for the perfect new summer dress :)


Beautiful little boutique full of fun designs. The shop keeper was a warm and kind person who was helpful to us as tourists. Thank you, love the cat  shirt!


Awesome t shirt designs and lovely staff!


I just happened to be wandering along Fan Tan Alley and came across this shop.  Placed outside was a basket of lovely scarves that caught my eye. Went inside to purchase one and was very impressed with the collection of apparel, etc. I will definitely return on my next visit to Victoria this spring.

Every time I‚Äôve been here the customer service is lacking. No one ever greets you, asks if you need a room or are friendly at all. My sister bought a dress here and wore it for a few hours and then the next morning wanted to wear it again, and there was already a hole in it. Cheap quality and bad service, will be skipping it from now on.


I discovered this store today and I absolutely fell in love!  They have great selection and very welcoming, energetic staff ! I‚Äôll be back!


Flavour downstairs has some good selection and reasonable prices. Flavour upstairs (vintage) is an absolute miss. It seems as though their entire collection is based on an 80 year old lady named Geraldine. A lot of the staff seem to embody that, with a general vibe of 'get off my lawn' instead of welcoming customers in. Many items are priced more expensive than their retail price... I'd say stick to downstairs storefront or avoid altogether.


They've done a great job of curating their clothing and the prices are all fair. Really funky clothing and great customer service. I had a really good experience with a girl named Lily who made our day! She was very kind and went out of her way to help us out.


I used to avoid this store because they carry a variety of brands and the sizing can be a bit of a nightmare if you're a curvier person like me.

The staff that are at this location now are very laid-back and approachable people. I really enjoyed my last visit and bought a gift for a friends birthday, and was pleasantly surprised when the sales associate helped me wrap the earrings and ensure it was ""gift ready"".

If you like cute clothes in various styles, definitely check this place out!

Entitled ownership and management that do not display in a clear and visible manner anywhere in their store, the fact that they do not do cash refunds. During my attempt at a return for a refund I reminded the cashier that I asked my salesperson during the purchase about a return, and was told that it was. Management then comes to explain to you that what his salesperson really meant the day before was - that a return is never for your hard earned cash back, but rather for this stores small print tucked away hidden policy of an in-store credit only. Poor!

Four Horseman Management - Your reply to my review is a joke!
Your attempt at trying to falsely flip the narrative and remove the focus of my NEGATIVE review from your HIDDEN no cash refund policy - to false claims about my behaviour is insulting to all those who read reviews. Your character in this regard only further undermines your business practices & credibility - from boutique to garage sale - buyer be ware!


The staff are always so nice and helpful, even if you are not buying anything. They prices can be high, but the quality of the items is as good as it gets. Everything is always clean and organized. It is much nicer then most other clothing stores.


I walked into the shop this summer on a mission to dress better and improve me style. The staff always has good feedback and knowledge if what they are selling. Were its from, where it's made, history if the company. Makes dressing an experience. Props.

Apologies for giving you poor rating, product was better but customer handling could have been better.
I bought Nike Jordan last week along with Nike tees, was greeted & treated very well, appreciated during my first visit.

I decided to exchange my tees after couple of days of my visit, so I visited the showroom and was greeted by one of Employees and I handed over the tees and told her I want to exchange, poor experience started from
here.
She straight away said it‚Äôs not from this store I can‚Äôt exchange, one of your staff went back to check the stock and confirmed it‚Äôs from this store and I was kind of laughing, then she asked for Tag which I had but not along with Tees, had bill which they gave me, I think it was paid receipt, for actual bill copy I gave them my email Id on my first visit but I didn‚Äôt get my receipt on my email Id.
But then she asked for Bill, so I shown her that copy which I had and even while checking that receipt she said it‚Äôs not from
our store, I still had smile on my face( Awkward one), then after checking the name of Employee she could make out because she was working at that point of time and then asked when did you bought this stuff, I said last Friday and I visited on Monday, which means after 3 days of purchase, she was like, it‚Äôs been more than a week so we can‚Äôt exchange it‚Äôs in our policy and shown me their policy then I had to clarified, ‚Äú I took 3 days ago, last Friday.
Then she asked for email Bill which I didn‚Äôt received, but after checking my Junk finally I got my bill and was able to exchange and then I bought another Tees in exchange paid the difference, she took my almost 5-10 mins in all that conversation.
After the billing I left the store without even realizing that security Tag wasn‚Äôt removed by the cashier, on which she has to call me back even when I was few steps away from store one of their staff came and informed me about the Tag, which actually beep while I was exiting but I didn‚Äôt even realized that it still had Tag.

She was rude, she assumed I am here to ask for a refund and trying to be a fake customer even without realizing and hearing my concern she predetermined everything, I was like, this is how you treat you customer who comes for return or refund.

I visited on dated 15th May around 2pm, just hope your staff may learn some basic etiquette and few customer handling skills could have been better for the brand, predetermining everything could have been worse at times.
She spoiled the day.


This is the perfect place to shop street wear in Victoria. Staff there are really kind and helpful. I really love the ‚Äúone pair of shoes for one household‚Äùrule when new shoes drop. It gives everyone equal chance to get the shoes for retail price. That‚Äôs really considerate. I‚Äôll definitely go there all the time.


I‚Äôve passed this place for a number of years and been in a few times. A strong selection of streetwear, and a excellent curation of the latest trends. I‚Äôm no sneakerhead but I was looking for a leather upper with the classic ‚Äògum‚Äô sole. I asked the staff ‚Äúwhat dictates your colour selection‚Äù as I was looking for a particular colour. Instead of asking ‚Äúwhat are you looking for‚Äù or ‚Äúcan I help you find something in particular‚Äù I was sassed hard with ‚Äúwhat you see is what we have‚Äù.  Retail customers are hard to please, I get it. But c‚Äômon sister! A little kindness goes a long way.  All was redeemed as another gentlemen helped me try on a couple sets of kicks and after some camaraderie, he certainly helped me make that ‚Äúpurchase decision‚Äù.

I walked past your store about 2 months ago and loved the jeans that I saw. I thought finally stylish/flattering shapes and good quality denim for a reasonable price. I spent the past 2 months saving up my tips to buy a pair of jeans for work. Today I  was so excited to go buy one pair. I tried one on and 30 was just a bit too small so I asked if there were any 32s or 34s and no your brand doesn't even make jeans that big. I was so embarrassed and disappointed. It sent me Into a very bad place with my self image I actually couldn't hold back tears as I left the store. Please keep in mind that this is not normal for me, I have a very good self image that I've worked hard for after years of body dysmorphia and eating disorders. everyone in my life makes me feel good about myself .  But after leaving your store I immediately felt like I need to loose weight even though I'm a completely normal and common size. This should have never happened in a store like yours. Please please please pass on this message to someone who is in charge of ordering inventory. You need to be more size inclusive!
Alternatively have a sign on the door that says ""do not enter if your waist is larger than 30 inches""
Because seeing that would have been so much less painful for me.


Has always been a favourite local boutique of mine, and many treasured pieces from Meraki grace my closet. When you can catch a sale there, you better believe it‚Äôs a bomb deal, too! Tonight, my aunt, who was visiting me from up island, and I popped our heads in shortly after the store closed (Good Friday, we were unsure..). The owner, Kylie, was kind enough to let us in anyway, to have a little shop around. It meant a lot because my aunt needed a couple cool pieces and she doesn‚Äôt make it to Victoria to shop all that frequently. Kylie, thank you for being so accommodating and staying a bit late for us tonight‚Ä¶ it did not go unnoticed! We will be back, as always.


I purchased some shoes here and when I got home I noticed a small rip in the leather. When I brought these shoes back the next day, I was greeted by Lauren. She was most accommodating and apologetic. She offered me numerous solutions to the problem, giving me the option of what would suit me best. I was very impressed with the customer service Lauren provided and the knowledge she had of the brands they carry. I highly recommend this shopping experience.


Poorly managed boutique with low service standards. They shipped out a pair of sunglasses to me without making sure the correct pair were in the box. Now they state they are no longer in stock, even though they are still on their website. Get a grip on your inventory! I do not recommend.


This boutique offers a jaw-dropping selection of precious apparel, which is complimented by a usually warm and friendly staff. However, my appreciation for this store was tarnished by the rudeness of an employee not long ago. I was looking at some shoes and we started to strike up a conversation. She seemed friendly until she asked if I'd like the shoe in my size and I jokingly said ""No"" and started to explain why. However, upon saying ""No"", she immediately turned on her heel and walked away from me. She then made a rather theatrical point of refusing to look at me during the remainder of my stay, which I ended promptly. This snobbish behaviour made me feel extremely embarrassed and uncomfortable. Most of the staff are great so I will be back, just not for a while.

I'm Caucasian, but was raised with a heavy Indian influence, and I fell in love with this store! The ladies are so sweet, and give great, honest recommendations. I'm finally able to find indian-inspired clothing that isn't necessarily a sari. Definitely going to be ordering online, as I live in central Alberta lol. The fabrics are gorgeous, and I love all the different styles of shirts, kraftans, dresses, pants, and skirts. Please visit if you love this style of clothing!! If you have trouble with sizing, please try things on to make sure you like how things fit.


Staff were lovely and this rating in no way reflects them. I was delighted to receive a pair of beautiful silk pyjamas for Christmas, but upon wear they completely fell apart at the seams. My mother thought the $120 price tag would have inferred a higher quality, and we are both incredibly disappointed by this outcome. This was my first product from this store and it will likely be my last. I'm sorry to leave a bad review, but this was super not cool.


I tripped across this store on a recent trip to Victoria, and I had to write it a great review. It is in the mall that has the Hudson Bay as the anchor store. The fabrics are beautiful and the patterns are very boho-chic. I am always intimidated going into new clothing stores, as I am 5'4"" and have a big bust, which makes it hard to find clothes that fit, and I often leave disappointed. The sales gals were so friendly and explained that they are cut for real women (not just skinny model types) and so I tried on a few pieces. To my delight- they fit! They have maxi-dresses that aren't sooo long that they drag on the floor even with heels, which was a super-bonus. I bought two! That night I wore one out and my friend loved my dress so much I went back and got one for her as a gift. I will definitely will be back on my next visit! P.S. to the store owner- your sales gals are adorable and doing a great job!


This is my new favourite store. I bought five of their Gaby dresses because I loved the cut and how it looked on me, so I got as many patterns as I could afford. I also have one of their kaftans (made from recycle sari's) which is beautiful. I get all sorts of compliments on the kaftan, and I love how it is so forgiving on my post-partum figure. I also got one of their camel leather belts which is incredibly resilient (and the story behind how they are sourced is amazing). I am looking forward to one day buying a kantha quilt from them. The staff are incredibly helpful and super friendly, they gave me just the right amount of tips and tricks to make the fashion work for me.


High quality work with an original flair. While the majority of my closet is Chai and I have been shopping there regularly since 2015, I gave 4 stars simply because the clothing doesn‚Äôt accommodate large breasts. Even though a medium would be most appropriate to my build I often have to buy L/xl to go over my chest and then belt the waist.

Lots of very cute minimalist pieces and a very pretty store overall. The main reason for my review is that the woman helping me was so fun and outgoing. I didn‚Äôt catch her name but she made my experience so amazing; I‚Äôve never felt so good going clothing shopping before! This woman is definitely an asset to the business and a natural salesperson.


Folk is the best clothing store in Victoria -- hands down. The quality is excellent and the items are carefully selected for their aesthetic and clean silhouettes. As a busy, small-business owner, I don't have a lot of time to get dressed in the morning so I appreciate that anything I get at Folk I can throw on in the morning and instantly look professional, stylish and put together. I'm surprised to see people complain about prices -- as an adult, you look at a price tag and willingly walk to the cashier to buy something. If items are available in other places, i.e. online, posted prices often do not reflect shipping and customs, which can quickly jack up the price. (This recently happened to me with a jacket I bought online, and it increased the price of the jacket by 35%. In hindsight, I wished I had given that money to a local business instead of Canada Customs.) Additionally, the prices at other places do not reflect their culture. Buying something online to cut costs can mean that employees on that end are paid minimum wages, whereas at Folk the employees are local people with good jobs and happy smiling faces. If I want a $6 t-shirt, I'll go to H&M where my stepson shops. In the meantime, I'm a business professional and plan to continue giving to local businesses and looking fly while I do it. A pic of my favourite tunic is attached, which I got at Folk and for which people stop me on the street to ask where I got it every. single. time.


Walked in here thinking I wouldn‚Äôt find anything as I wear plus size. The woman working, who I‚Äôm assuming isthe owner, was immediately so warm, friendly, and personable. I pulled a pair of gorgeous linen pants on to try and she had me give her a little fashion show, it made me feel so special. She brought me so many other cute vintage and non vintage plus size pieces to try and was SO attentive. I felt like I was shopping with a friend. The other staff members were just as kind and sweet!

This shop is amazing and also so well curated and gorgeous. I highly recommend checking it out, even if it‚Äôs just so the very nice pretty ladies working there can share their positive energy with you. It really made my day and now I have a well made pair of pants I‚Äôll probably have for the rest of my life.

Thank you guys for making my day!!


Bought an amazing vintage Escada dress here and I must say I
loved the vibe of the new location. Felt very warm and inviting. The owner Willow was super fun and very helpful and I felt very looked after as a client. It‚Äôs hard to find exceptional customer service these days and I felt the owner was beyond exceptional and that a lot of private stores in Victoria could learn from her example. Thank you again for an awesome shopping experience and a fabulous dress!


LOVE the vibe of this beautiful shop. The owner and all her staff are pure magic. Its incredible to walk into such an amazing space, and get this? THEY ACTUALLY SAY HI TO YOU WHEN YOU ENTER!! So important in my opinion. I love the mixture of vintage clothes, what a smart idea. The owner is always a dream to speak too, and AWAKE non the less. Which in these ""fake woke"" days is VERY HARD to come by. I will absolutely be back and so looking forward to the next time....ALSO, what is with people complaining about no refunds? lol what planet do you live on that you think refunds are just given to you by a small business, IT'S ALWAYS IN STORE CREDIT. So stop your btchin' trolls, these woman are incredible. If you don't dig where the clothes are made, stop trolling and kindly shop elsewhere. Needed to get that off my chest as BULLY'S and me DO. NOT. VIBE. I will absolutely be back

Prices are reasonable too. Highly recommend a browse.


Rude and pretentious employees. I had gone in to look for a top for a family member a little while back and decided not to buy from there after my experience with the two female employees.

One of the ladies behind the counter kept sighing, rolling her eyes, and exchanging judging looks with the other employee out of nowhere. As I browsed the tops, the other hovered extremely close to me through the whole store as if I were going to steal. That same lady made some sly unsolicited comment about how I may not be able to find anything within my price range, despite me not ever mentioning my budget.

I am by all means not a dirty, sketchy-looking person, nor was I rude at any point in time so it was all so absolutely confusing as to why they were treating me like that right from the get-go. All I did was walk in, say hi, then keep to myself as I looked through the tops. I've had a friend and another family member share similar experiences here as well. Weird and disappointing.


My wife likes this store. They have good sales. Also Canadian made dresses etc. Staff seem really helpful and knowledgeable.


If you want to wear something that no one else has,  and if money's no object,  then this is a Don't Miss It stop on your shopping trip.

This is such a cute store, with really lovely dresses.  They're reasonably priced and the lady that runs the store is super sweet and helpful, grabbing sizes and recommending things.

I don't live in Victoria but I saw a dress I liked on their Facebook page and it was out of stock.

I showed them discount label and it was snowing $65 and she charged me $80 and something.I ask for my money return.She can't refund money on my card even it was not my fault and she gave me another gift card.I don't shop here often. I will never recommend this place to anyone.


This location no longer exists. Fun place to shop tho! Lots of clothes to find for super cheap prices. Don't expect the clothes to last more than 3 washes but for the price, and as long as you try stuff on; Fun and worth it!


Thanks to all the staff today at your uptown location. June 26th 2017.
I'm not a girly girl and I have a odd shaped body with curves and rolls. Buying a dress is a nightmare and walking into fancy stores is intimidating. All the dresses wer so adorable and I'm so thrilled I found something. Thank u so much! I'll be returning when I can üòä

You want to try everything on. They have lots of beautiful spring colours. Top ladies store in Victoria.


I have always loved the selection that Dancing Lily has to offer, I always find several items that I love.  The quality of the product lines are excellent and Lili & staff are very knowledgeable. Customer service is always above and beyond expectations both in person and online.


I adore this boutique! I live in Hollywood and I make a point to shop here every time I visit because the owner always has a fantastic selection. I‚Äôm very impressed with the lines she carries,  I recently purchased a pair of Ted Baker shoes and absolutely love them. Great staff and the owner is delightful and very helpful. Overall, a positive experience every time. Wish she had a shop here in LA!!


Went in and got to talk to the owner, she was very helpful without being pushy or overwhelmig and so positive it was contagious! I left with a gorgeous blue dress that I‚Äôve worn multiple times and still love. Will be shopping there again, I Highly recommend and thanks again Miss Dancing Lily!


Beautiful displays and a great range of sizes. Window displays are always so welcoming inviting you in to a warm and friendly atmosphere. The owner, Lil, is herself warm, welcoming and goes above and beyond.

Extremely terrible customer service.


Very unique items, ranging in mid to high price points. Lovely selection and great service.


Looking for local jewelry?  This is the place. Very reasonably priced.

A good selection of women's clothing, dresses, Up pants, casual and dressy and more. Summer stock is coming in and varied selection.  4 dressing rooms.  I saw several tops I would of purchased that were outside what I have seen anywhere else but only small or very large sizes left.  Good to stop in more often to see the new items. I think they have an avid following.


This unique store has very nice clothing displayed in colour coordinated sections. Although there are a wide range of sizes, there may only be 2 of each size. New clothing arrives regularly so check back from time to time and see what's new.


Excellent customer service and overall great feel to the store (Courtenay). I was shopping for a gift for my wife and was comfortable doing so.


This is my favorite place to shop! You can find wonderful clothes you won't find anywhere else. Something for every woman of any age and size. Staff are wonderful and helpful. I can't recommend this great little women's clothing store more! Check it out, you won't be disappointed


This place has some very unique and wonderful clothing! Super soft fabrics, range of sizes, Vancouver designers and Italian stuff too! Staff is super friendly and helpful. Worth taking the drive to Cook Street if you don't live in the area.

The owner and staff are amazing. They know their products really well,  where they are made and how. They choose products that are made ecologically if they are from abroad and choose local whenever possible. They are expert at choosing the right garment and fit for any occasion or just for casual wear. Claudia and Zoe are the kind of personal service you want in a store. Jamie is an amazing esthetician. I had the best facial I have ever had from her and I have had facials world wide over many years. Incredible team! Thank you!


This is my favourite store in Victoria for clothing and fashion accessories. The staff are always super friendly and helpful plus they educate themselves on the brands and the products they carry. They are selective and pick pieces that are of the best quality, which is honestly hard to come by in a Victoria. They carry brands that you can‚Äôt find elsewhere In the city which is refreshing and a nice change from the other boutiques which carry the exact same products as the store next door and the store next door to that...They still honor shopping local, but they branch out as well.  I love their denim selection! Aside from clothing their jewelry selection is amazing as well! be sure to look at the pieces in store by Lizzie Fortunato!! They have a wonderful selection of spa essentials as well :)


I've been going to Bernstein for my skincare for over a year know. Zo√´ is incredible at knowing exactly what I need to have radiant healthy skin for my very sensitive skin type. She even picked out makeup that was exactly my shade just by looking at a picture. Shipping is immediate and beautify packed. I've never had skin like this before in my life! I'm so happy I found out about this amazing little shop and I couldn't recommend their service more.


I absolutely love this store and it's selection of brands - it is very honestly my go-to store here in Victoria. Claudia and Zoe are so wonderful and their impeccable customer service is rare these days, and something I genuinely appreciate. I will continue to recommend this store to anyone and thank these fabulous ladies for their amazing service and style.


Bernstein is Gold!!!
If you want beautiful clothes and Jewelry that you will love forever this is a girls one stop shop for everything lovely including an amazing skincare line and a dayspa. The prices are great, the products are high quality and cutting edge and the customer care is fabulous. A decadent shopping experience even for a casual window shopper, or simply anyone who loves beautiful things....

So tried to return it to the Victoria store but they wouldn‚Äôt take it back as the tag was damaged but still attached.  I had the receipt and it clearly states that it can be returned to any store but they still wouldn‚Äôt accept it, they claimed that the barcode on the attached tag was damaged but this is how it was received.  I tried customer service but as it was the weekend it was closed. I took the option of emailing customer service through the w49 website but have not received any response, it‚Äôs been 4 days now and nothing!!

I‚Äôm quite sure I‚Äôm not going to get a response and don‚Äôt expect this store to be in business much longer with such terrible customer service like this.

If you buy anything from this store be sure it fits because if you want to return it, they‚Äôll come up with a lame excuse as to why you can‚Äôt get a refund.

I feel bad for the assistant manager I dealt with as she was clearly new at her job and had no support from her manager or head office, it all starts from the top!!


Love this store, always buy for family here plus the odd sweater and toque for myself.  Nice quality and great customer service.


Nope! Never shopping here again! They won't do refunds with full receipts. All stores I know of will give a refund with full receipt and tags on. Not this one. Bought the wrong hoodie for my daughter.  Now they don't have the same line to replace it. Got a store credit.  There's nothing else she likes so it's useless!
Beware! Once you spend your money here it's gone for good  no matter what!
Nope, never again!


Great prices and selection of trendy shirts, hoodies, skateboards, longboards, scooters and shoes. The store is generally busy and merchandise well displayed. Staff are helpful.


My wife and I ordered a trick scooter on November 27/2020. They did not ship or process our order until the 13 of December. Are you kidding me and you are still in business. Now my daughter will not get her present in time because of an incompetent company. Worst service by any company to date. They really should be ashamed of themselves. 20 days to process and ship is so disrespectful. Pure disappointment and totally rude on a big store like this. Forget this company
