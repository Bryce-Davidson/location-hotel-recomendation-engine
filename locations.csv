ChIJ1e5UJJF0j1QR6VpPNf8TYiQ,Royal BC Museum,4.6,48.4198111,-123.3674497,8658,"Great museum has very nice and extensive exhibits. I went there when they had the wildlife photo-journalism exhibit which was a interesting one. It wasn‚Äôt busy whatsoever but I did go on a rainy Sunday around 3:00. Would definitely recommend going. It also seems like there was a third floor exhibit but for some reason it‚Äôs closed and I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe it will be open sometime in the future.The Grand Dame of Museums in Victoria, BC.  In the heart of the city; next to the Iconic Empress Hotel and across from the Famed Victoria Harbour. The displays in the different themed exhibits are awesome! The extensive information and detail in the displays is fabulous. Plan on spending a minimum of three hours; more, if your a history buff!This is one of the best museums we have visited. It has natural history, art, First People cultural history, and an interactive town/ship/ mine from British colonial history. Really great. Two weeks ago,  that section was closed for remodel. I'm hoping it is still as awesome as ever when it reopens.Great place to visit and learn about the ice age and stuff. They even had a showing of covid portraits which was cool.

Likes: it was cheap. $5 per person and it was absolutely worth it. Lots to see and learn.

Dislikes: Nothing I can think ofMust visit!! But set aside at least 3 hours for this place. On Saturdays(Summers I think) they are open until 10pm, which worked in our favour.There is so much information to absorb in limited time. During our visit - The first floor was dedicated for First Nations, Second floor of Animal evolution, Third floor was set aside for Stu the dinosaur (T-Rex fossil discovered in Canada) and the related discoveries. We also had the opportunity to visit -The Angkor wat display- which was excellent, but many of the idols were missing parts while on exhibition :(. The museum is well-maintained, clean, wheelchair accessible and has very friendly staff."
ChIJmXc0Z6J0j1QR4CJUS73dyZk,Fisherman's Wharf Park,4.5,48.42195,-123.3830139,7518,"A popular tourist attraction on the Victoria waterfront, near the floating homes (not houseboats). There are multiple food vendors, some of which also sell alcohol. Not all businesses were open on a Sunday evening.

Expect crowds, but a fun spot to find and enjoy the waterfront, especially at sunset.

Water taxis available to take you anywhere around the harbor for $12/person one way. There is a parking lot near the children's playground.

The area is walking distance to Old Town.

There is one restroom on the dock.Man,we loved this place!!! Great tiny little restaurants and bars on the water across from a marina. Heads up, some of these quaint little houses are available through Air BnB so check before you book a hotel. You can walk right into the heart of the city from there. Beautiful views at night when all the lights come on. Worth the visit. You will need at least three or more days to take in all that is offered in this city. Enjoy!Lovely place with colourful buildings on the water. In the place you can see restaurants, ice cream shop, galleries and houses. There are public washrooms in the place. Really nice atmosphere. Next to the place there is a big lawn and small playground. There is a pay parking lot and free parking spots on the street. Highly recommended to visit here.This is pretty. Unfortunately we were there on a rainy day. I like colors of shops and houses. I wonder what benefit private home owners get bit allowing visitors walk besides their homes? I do not think it is fun to live there were you would be on the public eyes all the time. I liked seeing houses, shops and water taxes, a pretty picture. We had fish and fries and I did not enjoy fish at all. It was fish with very bland batter and was not tasty at all atheist for me.  Overall it is a mist visit place for sure.Beautiful place üòç  . With floating  houses  . And restaurants  . Its a must see in Victoria  . Its got Washrooms and car / bike   parking  and nearby public transportation.    . Its nice marina  .  And green park with a kids play ground and  picnic tables and Adirondack chairs  .  Note its fall season  not every restaurant or business is open here ,but still some  are open here even in fall season  .   The pizza  ,gifts  shop ,the candy shop are closed  . The ferry boat does  stops here  .   Summer  looks more lively for this place in terms of places here being open .   Thier is one house boat B&B   but the rest of the  floating houses are definitely not open to public they are private residents  but people can walk on the open docks to view them . Its pay parking  . And free  bicycle parking."
ChIJ13vUgIp0j1QRbx3mZXLZILI,Craigdarroch Castle,4.5,48.42262940000001,-123.3437226,4836,"This is a neat, old castle that was built well over a hundred years ago. Unfortunately they were not allowing tours when we visited as repairs had to be made. That said, parking on the street is free and walking the grounds is as well. There is a large, grassy area on the north side that the neighborhood kids were playing football in.

If you can get here for a tour, I think it would be well worth the fee. As is, I was able to enjoy some kids making use of the acoustics of one of the openings below parking level and snap several photos. There is a lot of history in Victoria and this is just one example.This is a relatively small castle. However, I spent almost 2 hours there! The staff and volunteers are super nice and helpful! They also show that they do care about the castle! If you have any questions, ask them! They gave me a lot of information outside the brochure!

The restoration work is an ongoing process, so some of the rooms are not fully restored. I guess I could come back for a second visit after a few years!Visited here during my trip to Victoria and it was absolutely worth it. My favorite part was the fact I was able to walk around freely without a tour. I personally am not a fan of tours with random people. There was staff however throughout the building incase you had questions and they were also super friendly and knowledgeable on the place. The place is an amazing piece architecture, with such deep history. Definitely a must visit if your looking for something to do.Friendly staff. They will answer questions about the castle. A castle build with some modern technology. Some rooms were converted during college use. Some were restored to original.  It has flush toilets. A shaft next to kitchen to bring food up. Make sure to enjoy stain glasses. Some stairs are a bit steep when going down. Visitors center has clean bathrooms. Parking can be a bit hard.The one activity planned today was to visit the Craigdarroch Castle ‚Äì more of a 5 story Victorian mansion. Frozen in time was a good description of the mansion as the ornately decorated rooms reflected the period. The map with information was an excellent guide as were the staff who offered us additional information as we went from floor to floor or asked if we had any questions. And the storyboards provided more information on the family, the building or its rich history (home, hospital, college, etc.). Excellent stained glass, wood work and tile. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit on this hot Mother‚Äôs Day."
ChIJa4uQ3-p0j1QRDtSaFQ5NHrQ,Beacon Hill Park,4.7,48.4122222,-123.3627779,8431,"This is a beautiful and well thought-out park. There is a really tall totem pole, a tennis court, a lawn bowling (croquet for the Americans), a long beach walk, a series of groomed, wood chip trails through woods as well as concrete and a children's playground.

While we were there we were lucky to come across a peacock, sparring for crumbs with a squirrel and an owl we interrupted the lunch hunt for. There were many birds, squirrels and creatures talking and singing as we walked through the woods. The beach trails is impressively long and gorgeous. There are many flowers still blooming in mid-June along the walking path. There is an unfenced, grassy area between the road and the beach path where dogs are allowed off leash. On the path, they are requested to be on-leash.

The park is not large but packs a lot in for the space it takes. I would highly recommend a visit.

Parking is free for up to three hours and thirty minutes. Washrooms are available in a brick and mortar building and are automatically flushing. They are gendered however.This is one of the coolest city parks I've been to. It seems to shift in ecosystem so drastically as you walk through it. It is well maintained and the park staff have been very open to questions. It is a lovely way to make your way to the shore, with many different paths to explore. The summer concert series was absolutely delightful, and I look forwards to next year. Be warned: there is a lot of water fowl poop in some areas, so look before you sit!One of the best parks here in Victoria. The best for joggers and cyclists. The Beacon Hill Children' s farm in here is a major attraction for kids and adults with a petting zoo. This beautiful park is full of majestic dancing peacocks , Goose's and Ducks and tonnes of HeronsAmazing sight to behold here. The peacocks,  Canadian geese, and cranes fill the air with noise. The pathways and restroom facility are well maintained. The big trees, willows, and unique vegetation make for plenty of sights. Go to the beach after your walk in the park for an amazing contrast of nature.Beautiful park.  Now that there isn't any tents everywhere you can appreciate the beauty of the park again!

They have ponds everywhere, and flower gardens that are well maintained, and the wildlife has returned to the park. Highly recommend coming to the park for an hour. Lots of space to read a book or just enjoy life."
ChIJS9YYcJB0j1QRPWHIFtwTr18,Victoria Bug Zoo,4.5,48.4232996,-123.3666683,1821,"My daughter and I had a fantastic time at the bug zoo. It‚Äôs a bit smaller than I was expecting but there are a lot of bugs to see!

My favorite part of the zoo were the people. I‚Äôve genuinely never went to a place where every single person working there seemed like they found their calling. The workers are passionate about bugs and it shows! It was such a fun experience for my little one learn and touch some bugs!Bug / Gift shop is free to enter. A lot of fun toys and gifts are available for decent prices. The actual paid access has some really cool insects and bugs on display if you can stomach it. Great for kids to see, touch (yes I said touch) and learn about. The facilitators are energetic and enjoy sharing their knowledge. Parents - this is legit a 20 - 40 min visit though. Plan accordingly. Overall - fun atmosphere for kids to learn about bugs and insects.Visited this hidden gem recently and was amazed by the quality engaged educators, service, and family fun this place offers!

We were allowed to hold stick bugs, millipedes, horney devils, touch beetles and more. The content was age appropriate and entertaining.

We witnessed a rare sight when a cockroach was seen giving live birth. Right next to another one that was freshly molted.

The ant display was neatly organized along the walls. They had spiders and praying mantis.

A good place to bring your children. It's a small (mini) zoo but they can spend time reading and learning.An awesome place to go if you're a lover of entomology, and regardless of whether you're a little kid, or a senior citizen, or a college student, or whatever, it's very welcoming.

The folks working there are really nice - the tour guide was informative and clearly cared a lot about their bugs, and the bugs themselves all seem to be doing well :)What a great place to visit with or without kids. Our group - 6 adults enjoyed our experience very much. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome and once we were ready we were taken to another room with all the creapy crawlies. At the time they had 2 lovely ladies explaining and answering any and all questions from visitors. Both ladies loved what they did as they talked with such love and passion for the animals which made me very comfortable being around spiders and other crawly critters. I would definitely recommend the Bug Zoo!"
ChIJ5ZScPpF0j1QRBLCY8tTvWsM,Thunderbird Park,4.3,48.4197936,-123.3666803,203,"Like the totems and of course worth visiting the place once.. free and just in. The corner of street. U can visit that while walking to beach hill parkIt's a minimalist location. More of a park with heritage to experience. It's changed over the years. There used to be more totems but things get old and totems are supposed to degrade over time. It's great that our indigenous people have a place to display their heritage. I always enjoy seeing the display here. I hope it continues.What a great collection of amazing Indigenous artwork! There are several totem poles of various designs all within close proximity to one another. If you're in Victoria, you should take the time to walk through the park and check out these totem poles!Easy walk to, right beside museum and empress.Interesting poles, some slightly phallic in design üôà"
ChIJe6rc4Zp0j1QRGdn5alXwQtE,The Maritime Museum of British Columbia,3.8,48.4218702,-123.36631,165,"Its currently two big rooms  at this new location  .  They got a mini kids area here . Its not the big amount of museum collection like at the old location  but they are working on moving into a bigger location in  future &  the  government  needs to  help  them out better  . I always love the maritime museum of Victoria   and love supporting them üíó.     They currently got a fishing exhibit on .  The museum is LGTBQ+and wheelchair and pet friendly . And its free for kids under 12 and free for indigenous folks.Kinda sad really.
There's a room, maybe 150 sq ft with some models of ships ( really nice models, very detailed some 4' long ).
Maybe 10 or 12 ships.
There's another room with some examples of knots sailers use.
There's a box with 1 side gravel and 1 side sand and some miniature examples of various types of anchors you can put in the gravel / sand and see how they grab the bottom.
That's about it.
$10.00 admission, we looked around and read the little info cards on the model ships and were out in about 20 minutes.
I was totally underwhelmed and disappointed. You'd think we could do better.I am not really a big boat enthusiast but decided to check it out when they had an open house on Victoria day long weekend. I was pleasantly surprised to see a fabulous art show at the back of the museum (see attached pics) so it was well worth the visit for me. It is very small but it would take quite awhile to read and listen to everything they had on display there.The absolute worst way to spend $21.00. It would have been more entertaining flushing my money down the toilet than visiting this museum. It consists of 2 small rooms, smaller than my bedroom. Very over-priced, left a lot to be desired. Needs improvement. After 5 minutes you have seen all there is to see. Don't waste your money.As the other reviews have said... Very small. If the fee was maybe cheaper, it would be ok (and maybe attract more customers). Only went in for the Saturday themed playgroup which was good... If I paid just for the museum, it's not ok.."
ChIJQRgei5B0j1QRPcfjFwsz8Rc,Miniature World,4.6,48.4223763,-123.3669183,2222,"This place is so freaking cool. I thought it was maybe going to be a tourist trap but I'm so glad I went in. I can't even imagine the amount of work it must've taken to craft all these miniature scenes. Incredible amount of detail and so fun to look at. I loved that it was interactive with buttons to make things move and light up! If you're on the fence about visiting, do it!I brought my children here and they were fascinated with all the detail and how they could see inside many buildings. The displays are brought to life with trains that move or figurines doing light action sequences. The interactive buttons to press for noises or commentary are a nice touch as well. Staff were very courteous and helpful. It's great to see that this place is still available for us inquisitive adults and the little ones in our lives. We will be back next year.This place is great! Price is fairly affordable, and the detail in these dioramas is insane! If you don't care for details, you might blow through this place pretty quickly. But if you take your time to look at all the intricate details you can easily spend an hour or more here. Some of the displays have interactive buttons that make things happen on the diorama itself which is pretty cool. I think the only thing that would be cool is if they had some modern-day dioramas as well as all the old historic stuff.Went on a Sunday, there was no line up.
Outside is deceiving, once you go through you realize how big the museum is. It's interactive great for all ages.
Great history lesson with a little fairytale fun as well.
Highly recommend!Really enjoyed our trip to Miniature World. The thing I loved the most was not only was each display really detailed, there were descriptions above each display depicting what it was with some historical information too.

Personally highlight was the Canadian railway stretching from Vancouver in the west to the Atlantic coast in the East."
ChIJtYLvXIN0j1QRt8-HC3oDBHI,Victoria‚Äôs Chinatown,4.2,48.4293744,-123.3673305,4004,"Arguably the most vibrant place in Victoria. I walk through here all the time because the vibe of the space is so good. I love the sidewalk food options and the flow of the sidewalks through here. Such a special place and so many wonderful places to eat. Spend some time just sitting and watching the comings and goings.What a fun place to visit... we took a water taxi across the bay from Fisherman's Wharf to Chinatown it was a fun and different experience for only $12 a person. We had a cool  match on ice with almond milk. Right next to the Fan Alley.. it was yummy.
Note: a lot of items are listed in Canadian prices and our US $1.00 is equivalent to $1.20The home of then Famous Fan tan alley(Narrowest alley) and First Chinatown in Canada. One of the nicest, cleanest and safest Chinatown‚Äôs in Canada. Super fun to visit both in the day time and night time when all the lights are shining. Overall a great place to visit. The Chinatown in Victoria, British Columbia is the oldest Chinatown in Canada and the second oldest in North America after San Francisco's.Come on down and check out Canada‚Äôs oldest Chinatown. Browse through the many shops, or eat at one of the restaurants. The tea restaurant was one of my favorites. There is such a rich culture packed into a small area. You most definitely have to take a walk down Fan Tan Alley!Very nice Chinatown, clean, compact and felt safe unlike here in Seattle. The restaurants looked amazing and I will be back to try them. The cherry blossoms were in full bloom!"
ChIJUaaUw1l0j1QRNah_wARUIWo,Abkhazi Garden,4.5,48.4157067,-123.3261834,487,"Lovely one acre garden, tucked away in a residential neighborhood.

11 a.m. - 5 p.m. No entrance fee, but donations encouraged. Parking on the street.

Volunteers greet you and answer questions in the garden.

Tea House in the former home. Lucked out for an opening for afternoon tea, but reservations encouraged. $55 per person. There is also a four course tea, elevenses, and a few extra add-ons available. The three course afternoon tea with a pot of tea of your choice is $54. Very tasty and beautifully presented.

Friendly service, lovely setting. Be warned there are lots of annoying wasps on the terrace that swarm the tea tray even with a napkin draped over the tiers. There is indoor seating available as well.

Restroom/washroom inside by hostess stand and next to the gift store.Had tea and a walk in the garden. Tea was pleasant and tasty. Not the fancy high end atmosphere of other places in town but more choices than some places including elevenses selection. Garden has some interesting specimens and a couple of amazing huge peonies. You can buy some plants here as well.We went here for my birthday to experience the high tea, I reserved ahead of time and we got a beautiful seat by the window with a view.

The food was delicious and the tea perfect! If you go to the tea house I highly recommend the Royal Abkhazi High Tea! It consists of 4 courses and the herbal tea I had was Angelwater.

The Gardens were stunning! With beautiful assortments of flowers and alot of history the volunteers told us so much about this beautiful place.

I highly recommend checking out this place, the food is amazing and the gardens (especially at this time of year) are beautiful and blooming.Abkhazi is Vancouver Island's secret garden. It is an absolutely beautiful garden that boasts huge old rhododendrons that are artfully placed throughout. Granite outcroppings dictate the shape of the surrounding garden beds. It is the jewel of the island. An added bonus is the quaint tea shop that serves high tea in China cups. There's no entrance fee, but they appreciate donations.Peaceful walk through a beautiful space! If you want to enjoy tea service you have to book ahead. Lovely gift shop featuring local Artisan treasures."

An ideal place for families with kids. The playground has swings for little kids and big kids, a few climbable sea monsters and sea creatures, and a great pirate ship with a plank! Most importantly, there is a washroom right next to the play area with water bottle refill station and rinse-off station for sandy little toes. Our son loved this park and so did we!One of the best playgrounds I‚Äôve been to! Octopus slides, whale and sea serpent climbing structures, and many more ocean-themed original creations. The beach itself is sandy and clean. What a beautiful park!Beautiful park and beach. It has everything that a family can enjoy. I can spend a whole day in that park. Love that they also have zipline.Our favourite beach and park to visit when in Victoria. While busy at times, the beach has a tranquil vibe. Great for kids and for chill get-togethers with friends and family.Cadboro Gyro Park is a great place to visit in Victoria, British Columbia. It has a beautiful beach with soft sand and a section for dogs and another section for kids to play without dogs. The playground is really fun and boasts a kiddie zip line. There are also picnic tables and a large grassy area with washrooms.¬†It‚Äôs a great family park at the beach with free parking lot"
ChIJueKTCmtzj1QRxJZTfhNWlsY,Esquimalt Gorge Park & Pavilion,4.7,48.4463446,-123.4049493,1078,"This park is so lovely! City staff do a great job with upkeep. There is lots of parking (including disabled spot and EV charging), picnic tables for small and large groups, lighting, playground, washrooms and water fountains, a paved walking path along the water with benches for sitting and taking in the view of wildlife or people on the water, and even a beach. Swimming not really recommend here as there is a lot of goose poop. Large green space and also an off leash dog area. The Japanese Garden is gorgeous and the new Pavillion is also a beautiful building. This would be an excellent location for a wedding.Such a great place!!! This park is a local treasure!!! Wonderful landscaping with a nice path system bordered by gorgeous flowers and shrubs. The new building will be a fantastic addition to this and ib look forward to its opening!!!July 23/2022. 23¬∞C. The Esquimalt Gorge Park goes back a long way with Japanese history with a small garden that will
captivate you because of it's design. When we were there numerous small craft were getting ready to push off to go exploring.You must walk here to visit and enjoy. No parking until done construction.. Beautiful japanese gardens, has more potential as its being upgraded and im sure once the new centre is done the gardens will be looked after..It‚Äôs a very beautiful park. Found a sculpture exhibition going on which was breathe taking . Nice place to go on a walk by the water ways"
ChIJGdxzX_pzj1QRjbNBc7pVhgQ,Mount Tolmie Park,4.7,48.4569632,-123.3257163,1094,"Walked up early to watch the sunrise and it did not disappoint. Truly breathtaking sunrise with the sun braking the land and mountains including Mount Baker to luminate the ocean. I have seen the sunset and sunrise from the top, they were both excellent. Fun place to have a nice walk. Would recommend waking up early for the sunrise but even if you don't, Mount Tolmie is a great place to have a calm walk around and look at the city.A beautiful view with lots of hiking trails in every direction. A great place to have a walk in nature. Plenty of parking and a port a potty.Walkable and drivable! Little mountain inside the urban city, so you get to see the 360 degree view of this amazing tourism city. 180 degree of ocean and 180 degree of mountain, nothing better than this!Perfect place to view the sunsets, that being said, we were late to view it. It was cloudy but the sun was visible at points. It was our first time here, found it by fluke as we were leaving one destination for another and saw the sun break through the clouds and wanted a vantage point without all the trees that line the sides of the road. Seemed to be a popular place as it was somewhat filled in the upper and lower parking lots. Would definitely love to come back and relax and watch the sun cross the sky. Would recommend stopping in and take in the view of the city and the skyline..Overlook the city. Either in a car or by foot. It's a great spot to let the scenery sink in. Life gets busy, don't let go of the little things. This is a little thing, soak it up even if you're a local. You never know when your clock is up."
ChIJz9m76Op0j1QRZl1tXNXsoQU,Beacon Hill Children's Farm,4.7,48.4116201,-123.3634511,1456,"My 1.5 year old son and wife LOVED this place! We arrived to Victoria via cruise ship and had a day to explore. This farm was our first stop. It‚Äôs surrounded by a beautiful park and the animals were very social and seemed happy. Staff were around to keep an eye on families and pick up goat poop which was very much appreciated. There are wash stations in between animal areas and the farm was quite clean and well kept. Overall we had a blast and would recommend a pit stop here via pedicab to get the most scenic route!Affordable Children's Farm experience, around $5 for kids and i think $7 for adult...

Highlights of our experience are the close up interactions with birds & petting the goat... The alpaca's area was a bit stinky in my opinion.. Probably because of our timing (May) there's not much animals to explore..

But nonetheless, the place is worthwhile and a great exposure for kids to know the real world of animal on a  farm setting..I have a worst experience due to a racist staff in the goat petting area. As I went inside there is a baby goat came up to me seems like he needs a cuddle as I was about to pick him up the racist team member said you are not allowed to pick up the goat.
Later I saw him holding goats and giving it to people for cuddles and I saw other people too picking the goats themselves near him and he was ok.
But that racist man needs to learn that everyone is equal regardless of their age and color. You should learn some respect and don‚Äôt have double standardsIt's such a great place to bring your family or if you just need some petting goat therapy.  It's donations based and inside Beacon Hill Park.Haven't been since before covid. The donation is no longer optional which is good to know if you're on a budget. Two adults and our 1 and year old was 14 dollars. Masks are optional through the park but mandatory if you want to pet/visit the goats."

With old military ramparts and even a tunnel for old and young too explore.This park is well worth the visit. We‚Äôll groomed trails walk you through a historic military site with interpretive information and great views or Victoria and towards the Olympic Mountains. This is a high calibre (no pun intended) park with free parking and no entry fee. It‚Äôs dog friendly‚Ä¶ a real local gem.A nice place for a quick walk along the water, some historic sites and a beautiful view of the mountains!We stayed in an AirBnB right at the entrance of this park and it was stunning! You can watch the cruise ships come and go, as well as explore the old barracks. There is wildlife to watch, and very friendly locals walking their dogs.Fabulous park that we almost missed out on. We were confused by the locked gate and no parking signs every where near the entrance. Glad we took a chance and parked further down the street. The park had lots of pathways leading to the water and along the water. This is a great place to walk your dog and/or enjoy great views of Juan de fuca straight. There are benches along the look outs and even a picnic area. The park signs say the park is only open from dawn to dusk however. Overall a really nice park well worth the visit."

Along the shoreline, can have relax breeze of winds, that makes so much relaxing and comfortable!

The Mile Zero is the west of Canada starting point of Terry Fox Marathon!

It is so memorable which we can take pictures in front of the ""MILE ZERO"" sign and the statue of Terry Fox here!

when you come to Victoria, this is one of the places to visit!Amazing views. You feel like you are on the edge of the world.A highly significant monument worth a visit. The start of Trans Canada Highway, running all the way to Newfoundland. Moreover, the start of Terry Fox cross-country run.

Parking is tough when theres a lot of people.Had an awesome time walking around the area with my family. Before moving to the island, we traveled from Ontario and stopped at most of the monuments across Canada honoring Terry Fox and his courage to take on this journey. Just steps from the zero mile monument. Beautiful views of the ocean, especially at sunset walking along the beachfront or the trails above. Beacon hill park has some great views up on the hill with the Canada flag üá®üá¶. Got our exercise for sure, along with plenty of fresh air, sunshine üåûand friendly faces..Beautiful and reserved little rocky beach hiding across from Mile Zero Monument and down a long staircase. No ramps, so not wheels here...! Phone might connect with the US but mostly you get no signal there."
ChIJzRkkCld0j1QR9HI1k87CREQ,Gonzales Observatory,4.8,48.4132733,-123.3251087,127,"Extremely short walk from the parking lot. Single lane rough road of sorts leading up to a parking lot. Good viewing area and that's it.
The building wasn't open and I'm not sure it ever is. I could not find any signs indicating if the building is open to the public.
Bit of a waste of time unless you went strictly for the view
No tickets required, no wait in the viewing area.
You only need about 10 minutes to see everything
Garbage can in the parking lot.Hands down the absolute best observatory I‚Äôve been to all day. Will return for more sunrise-watching soon. Best wishes to all the dog walkers with their cute dogs. Walking your dog brings joy to so many people.Not sure if this place is still in operation but the views are amazing from here. Little parking lot just a short walk to the observatory. There is construction going on in the area, be aware of the blast horn and the explosion afterwards. There was another couple there and they looked concerned but we explained to them what just happened as you can feel it through the ground hundreds of feet away. We really enjoyed the day here, would love to come at night to see if this place come alive.Awesome views of the coast and very easy access, at least from the back. A bit more challenging up the slope from the front but there is a handrail on the steepest section. There are stairs and a rocky path up. Just be careful especially if wet or in poorly lit conditions.Great views of Victoria from the Observatory‚Ä¶..nearly 360 degrees.

The beach is great for looking for nice rocks and sea glass if you keep your eyes open!There is plenty of parking and the entire stretch has a walk path to walk and enjoy the beautiful sea and birds :)

The end of the park has a look out point and the starting of the walk path has a long pier to steps to walk down and enjoy the ocean waves even closer ! If you are lucky you will get to see some ships (pretty close) docked there !Really nice view from Clover Point and the rest of the park of the mountains and water. It‚Äôs quite windy here so a bit cold but good for kites and some other parachute excursions people go on. Some benches to sit on. One section does not have much parking. You can walk down a trail or path along the water or on the rocks too.Such a lovely place to enjoy the Strait and the mountains away to the south in the USA.

I see this as I‚Äôm sitting in my car at top parking lot admiring the expansive views.Amazing unobstructed beautiful views of the Oceanside. The day was perfect and we enjoyed a little bite to eat while taking in the sights. The kids enjoyed climbing on the rocks and trying to get the best vantage point. Plenty of birds, boats and people all taking advantage of what the island has to offer. This was our first time here but definitely not our last as this seems like it could be a great area to view sunrises and sunsets so we want to check that out.Fantastic viewing point. I wish we'd brought binoculars. The statue at the park was beautiful and had lots of hidden details.It's an amazing overlook, not sure I would call it a park. The views are amazing."

Its super quite and would definitely recommend to any person who loves art or either who is new in the city. ‚ù§Ô∏èLocated in a quiet neighborhood, this gallery+museum is certainly a pleasure to visit. Great place to learn about local artists and their works. Miscellaneous collections of handcrafts. Also many pieces from Asian countries. Good opportunity for local people to get a glimpse of the history of the far East. The space is well organized, with clear visiting route. The staff is friendly and helpful.The staff were lovely and helpful when I had a question about an exhibition! I could have spent another hour in there! I was bummed out I didn't get to see some Emily Carr pieces, but apparently they've been taken down recently to double check their conditions, but the 3 exhibitions happening made up for it! Definitely worth visiting!Loved how knowledgeable they were! Thank you, staff!Loved the Gallery exhibits, informative and thought provoking.

Out on a sunny ‚òÄÔ∏èüòé Day is nice too.I spent a year living close by. Every morning at dawn I would run along the breakwater from Ogden Point to Clover Point and count birds along the way. So far I've seen two Herons, incredibly a Harrier, uncountable Mergancers, sparrows, hummingbirds, mating displays, a large bird of prey, an eagle and a submarine. One of them was smaller than I had expected.More a walking path than a park but this beach front area is a must any time of the year to take in the classic views from Victoria.Nice place to spontaneously jump out of the car and get some sea airAbsolutely love this area of Victoria. Moved to Victoria a few months ago and stayed at an Air BnB across the street from this park. It quickly became my favourite area to talk daily walks with the pup. Gorgeous coast line, plenty of places to sit and even walk down to the beach. Favourite part is watching the fog or a storm roll over the ocean. Definitely recommend walking the path!"

A lot of ‚Äòthings‚Äô from the former owners were left behind when the home became a museum.  Tells the story of some lives of an earlier age.  Very knowledgeable volunteers.It was a fascinating experience learning about the family who lived here years ago. The grounds aren't huge but there is still a lot to see and learn. The garden tour highlighted some neat features about the grounds and it's definitely worth taking.For history enthusiasts! For locals and tourists! For fans of Victorian epoch! For anyone who‚Äôs fascinated by interior design! This place is a hidden gem! It‚Äôs so worth visiting! Pictures from the phone don‚Äôt do any justice to this stunning place! Staff is beyond amazing! They literally walked extra mile for us today. Guide was so lovely and extremely knowledgeable. Price is more than reasonable. Find the time to check this place! For high tea reservations are needed! Would love to come back!Point Ellice House is a beautifully preserved piece of Victoria history and  is a truly unique treasure located on the Gorge Waterway very close to downtown. What makes this home so unique is that it remained in the hands of the same family for three generations with all of it‚Äôs original contents and without any substantial redecorations. What you will see, including the wall paper, the fixtures, the furnishings, and the china, is all original and covers the period from 1890 through 1920.  It provides a rare opportunity to see one of North America‚Äôs largest collections of late Victorian and early Edwardian objects in an original, untouched Victorian home. It is now a National Historic Site and well worth a visit.  If you make advanced reservations, you can have afternoon tea in the garden.Definitely recommend checking out this museum. It's unique in that everything inside the house is from the original family, so it really feels like stepping back in time. The restoration of the grounds is very authentic as well. Going on the garden tour was very educational as the knowledgeable guide pointed out much of the plants and trees that are original to the house. The staff and volunteers are passionate about this historic place and warmly welcome you."

So stay away‚Ä¶. please!!
Today I visited and the wet logs/rocks were slippery. The water was cold (as always). And the trails were covered in natural fauna!! Saw a duck.We had a great visit, geocaching and taking photos and looking and listening for birds. Everything was wet as we just missed the rain. This is one of our favourite parks to explore.Nice little waterfront park just jam-packed with Garry Oak trees. It‚Äôs a really nice bit of wilderness in the middle of the city. The park is largely undeveloped and, as such, is brimming local with plant and animal life. It‚Äôs a great place for a picnic or a stroll. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area and looking for a quiet place to be in nature.I've lived in Oak Bay for 8 years and never visited this amazing park. It's like a beautiful wilderness right in the city. So many trails to wander easily along; it doesn't matter whether you go left or right at the fork, you never get lost. You are alone (perhaps with your dog, off-leash!) most of the time, but say easy Hello's with other park-goers and dog lovers when paths meet.

I also love that there are picnic tables all around outside so people can do their studying outside in the fresh air.The rhodendrons in early May are spectacular.  A nice wooded walk with many paths to draw your attention to another hidden bouquet. It's free other than the parking which is on university property.

If you're in the area during December evenings, the place is a marvel with wonderful light displays and music bringing the holiday cheer.Went by to see the lights that were put up for Christmas, and was somewhat underwhelmed. While there are some gorgeous displays, I think the display could have been choreographed much better. There was no flow to these decorations. Next year they should higher an artist to plan it for them.A place where the cold atmosphere of the end of the year is wrapped in warm lightIt was great entertainment and many talented performance.
The one big irritant was the extreme loud music and annoying louder people behind the switch board who screamed on the top of their long, there were some young children who covered their ears as elderly people.
I hope the organizers and managements help so we can save our ear drums.The lights were beautiful, the music was good. Food and drink venue was one that we lined up 30 minutes for hot chocolate, buy the time we got to order they where sold out. One Food vendor for an event you are expecting lots of people is a fail."

The statue is huge and lying on the floor, but there is no sign that to explain why this statue lying down?

There are couple of long bench nearby the statue, and for people going there to take pictures!

The view is absolutely spectacular on a clear day, you can literally see for miles in all directions. Nobody else was there when went and we were treated to an extra awesome surprise. A huge eagle had decided to sit and chill on the to of the monument. A woman was watching us from the roadside wondering why we all had our phones and cameras out, when she noticed the massive bird. She ran  grabbed her camera from her house and came back only to scare him off...Best spot for sunsets in the whole South Island.Pretty nice place to go for the sunset.

Right now there are Scotch broom and Camas blooming; the yellow and purple give a real Easter feel! My favorite spot is a little park bench that you'll find if you walk up to the top where the stone pyramid is, then down the other side of the hill. There is a gnarly Arbutus tree right next to it, and a fantastic view! See if you can find it! I have a YouTube channel; in the next couple of weeks I'm going to post a video that will show you how to get to that park bench! Check out my channel and subscribe so you don't miss it!

A fun experience that included a suspension bridge, beach waterfall, tide pools, and unique rock formations. Toni is a fun knowledgeable guide who absolutely loves her job and the area. Lunch was great ‚Äì the gluten chicken sandwich was delicious. Highly recommend getting a baked good when lunch is picked up. Worth the time and effort ‚Äì would definitely go on a hike with Rainforest Tours again!I had a wonderful time doing the East Sooke Regional Park - Aylard farm.  The views were breathtaking and well worth the time and money.  Toni was a great guide & hike compagnon!Was lucky enough to do a full day tour with Toni in East Sooke park!

It was just 2 of us with Toni and she was amazing. Having recently recovered from injury, Toni was attentive to my needs and provided lots of breaks (filled with nature facts) and the best lunch spots! She was well prepared with lunch, ponchos and extra gear if needed! Being safety conscious I was very happy to see she had a full ‚Äútrip binder‚Äù of maps and evacuation points if anyone was injuries, as well as an extensive first aid kit! We were able to go to two different locations because we finished our loop early.

I really appreciate Toni‚Äôs flexible planning and extensive knowledge of the routes she leads you on. She truly knows the land and has watched it evolve through the years, and it‚Äôs fascinating to hear what has changed through the years. This is my first guided hike, and now that I‚Äôve seen how great a local guide is, I can not be going back! I will absolutely be doing more of Toni‚Äôs hikes the next time I‚Äôm in the area, and I can‚Äôt recommend her enough!An awesome day in nature with Toni and Dan.  Simply excellent!We did a full day hike at the Southern Juan de Fuca trails (Mystic Beach). It was great! Toni was a well-organized, nice, and insightful guide.

We could have rented a car and planned our own exploration of trails near Victoria. But booking the Rainforest Tour was a great decision. We didn't need a car for the rest of our trip, so it would be an unnecessary expense and hassle. It was also much nicer to have someone drive us! Plus, Toni knew the best places to stop for a break and snack en route and the best trails to see. The experience was made simpler and stress-free by booking the tour. All we had to do was arrive at the pick up spot (Tourist Information booth at the Harbour) and enjoy the day. A key feature for us was that it was a small group (max 6 people).

Mystic Beach was an enjoyable destination. The trail is a good balance between nature walk and hike. There are areas where you have to mind your footing, so it is best to wear good shoes or even hiking boots. I wore good walking shoes and was fine. If you are not an experienced hiker, it should be no problem; just take your time and you'll be fine. This is a great day trip for all skill levels.

There was a heat wave the week we did the tour. It was ok in the trails: the tree canopy and ocean breeze created a very comfortable experience.

Next time we are in Victoria we will book again to see the old growth forests in the Northern Juan de Fuca trails."

This is a great Park. So many places to adventure to.The place I met on my way to the Victoria West Community Center. A beautiful Gorge water way and a nice Selkirk Trestle bridge catches the eye.Beautiful trails right by Gorge Waters with a well fenced and newer playground behind the YMCA building limited in parking but dog friendly.This was my second attempt at strolling through this area. I came a few weeks ago but the park was locked off with police tape due to an officer being attacked. The area is super quiet and seems like a nice place to relax. There is a beautiful view of the water and it has a floating dock the you can swim out too as well. Great place for walking or riding a bike as it leads out to the Selkirk Trestle. I highly recommend coming and exploring this location, I'm sure the incident was a one off as this is a beautiful family oriented environment with a playground not too far off for more enjoyment for the kids.Great spot for family swimming in the Gorge Waterway.

Enjoy the sunset or simply try and spot a seal. Perfect for viewing cruise ships. Great place to snap shots of the mountains and ocean.One of our ports during our Alaska cruise. We arrived at 5pm, walked around the pier and then took a bus tour. Very nice place to walk and we were hitting sunset so the views were great!!!This was a very nice area to relax and enjoy the view.

Some holes require you to place your ball and move the table or use paddles or chains to lift the ball out. I only visit Victoria once every few years, but I would definitely come back to play this course again.  Also, they offered a delicious ice cream sandwich that was gluten and dairy free and so so good. We visited on a Monday at dinner time with no reservation and we didn't have to wait.We had a fun time! We called ahead for a reservation but I think we could have walked in. They have food and drink available if you need something. The set and decorations for the different rooms were so cool and spooky. The lighting was  very dark and alternating bright and colorful, it was a little hard on my eyes but my son loved it. I thought it was a bit expensive but it really was fun and totally interesting. I think we could have easily finished in 20 ish minutes but we took our time to enjoy the sets and different holes.This place is so fun and loved the spooky theme. They have some creative holes that require you to use your hands or paddles. We also did Ping Pong which was fun and just a great time for my son's birthday while we were in Victoria. Would definitely return when we come back again. Definitely recommend booking online for both golf and Ping Pong especially on a weekend!An excellent time downtown with friends and family if you‚Äôre a fan of mini-golf!  Some excellent, creative holes that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else. Also, the haunted house theme was excellent!  Only flaws were I was hoping for more than 15 holes as well as the last hole felt lacking (our group loved it, especially the creativity but could have had another fun element to it).  Overall, worth a go one evening if you want to do something fun and different downtown.The themeing on this place is top notch, you can tell that the designers really put their entire heart into their work. Multiple hiles of mini gold that take place outside and inside a haunted house. The rooms which contain all kinds of props, effects, and video screens, tell a progressing story of a family's descent into madness. Imagine a darker Disney Haunted Mansion... it really is that high quality. Then add that you play mini golf inside... Unusual to be fair but awesome in execution. Soak it all in. They also have   a ping pong loft in the back, lockers to store your stuff, food and beverages... it's a great way to spend an afternoon or evening.

The roof is covered with golden glazed tiles, and decorated with Chinese supernatural creatures on the corner ridges. The two Chinese verses on the two front side-panels mean ""to work together with one mind"" and ""to help each other to achieve harmony.""Great chinese architecture. Well maintenanced.

Typical BC beach area with stony sand and driftwood!I came there at night, so I posted what my phone was able to capture: the sky. Cattle point is better for stargazing, but Harling Point works fine too (if you don't care too much about the Chinese Cemetery next to it).It was really to walk on the rocks. In addition to the colorful chairs, look for the bench a bit further down, to the left. It's really amazing to see the waves crashing just a few meters in front of youReally picturesque.

Beautiful and a great spot to admire the beautiful area. If you've never been under this bridge, do yourself a favor and visit. Read the signs, they have a great story to tell.Beautiful spot for a break, or for a walk. The Tillicum Narrows, known as the Canal of Camosack back in the 1800‚Äôs is located on the Gorge Waterway in Victoria, BC, Canada. Reversing rapids are caused by the narrow pinch point at Tillicum Narrows where a large amount of tidal water is forced through the narrow passage. Currents have been known to reach up to 9 knots (17km/h) here. The tides caused by the moon make massive amounts of water move up and down the gorge and this unique feature makes for white water rapids, waterfalls or a surging channel depending on the water height. A bridge was built here due to the narrow crossing. The current bridge is the seventh incarnation.Picture was taken when the tide was receding down to .29m. The roar of the water was louder than the traffic above on the bridge.Interesting spot, especially the views of the bridge and the water flow."

They took us ahead of our scheduled time.  We scheduled an extended tour of the area.  It was a very quiet and enjoyable ride.  Since it was late in the day, toward the end of the tour, we requested an early drop-off at the ship, and they accommodated our request.  Our guide was outstanding and gave insights into the local culture.  Our tour horse, Sampson, had a pleasant personality.  We would do this tour again.We had the best time this past week with our Tally-Ho horse and carriage ride. We were extremely lucky to have Anna and Maggie as our tour guides. They were both very knowledgeable about the area. Maggie knew her route and seemed to really want to get up and go, she appeared to enjoy working. Anna kept both of my young children entertained with her history lessons and horse knowledge. I would recommend Tally-Ho for anyone looking for something to do in Victoria.We did the 45 min Beacon Hill Tour on Oct 18, 2022. 4 adults fit comfortably in the carriage. Sampson (our horse) and Tyler ( or guide) were both amazing. Tyler answered all our questions about Sampson and had interesting facts about the areas we went past such as history of house paint colours and some fun facts about Emily Carr.  He had a great sense of humour and I must admit, I enjoyed when he pointed out a squirrel with ""an especially fluffy tail.""
Heads up for guests, there are 2 carriage companies across from each other on the corners and they seem to alternate corners so make sure you read the sign on the podium.
My one piece of feedback for the company would be getting the guides some kind of portable microphone to make it easier to hear the guides.
For any one concerned about the horse's welfare, you can tell the love the company and guides have for them. They do track air quality and cancel accordingly. Tyler was able to tell us so much about Sampson's personality, such as his favourite length of tour (45-60 mins).Best tour, sweetest driver (wish I could remember her name)! So accommodating and got us in right at sunset. Horses are very well cared for and have a good relationship with their driver.We had such a great ride in the carriage pulled by Clay the Clydesdale! Our driver and guide, Debbie, was so friendly and easy to chat with. She was very knowledgeable about the area and had great recommendations for other things to do after our tour.

Has great views of the harbour and the ocean front. Sometimes when cruise ships are in port it can be very busy. On windy days you are quite exposed to the wind and possibly ocean spray.  Historically there were no fencing on the breakwater but now they have railings along the top on both sides. At a few points, you can go down stairs to access the lower breakwater. The lower break water can be difficult to walk on as it is just large rectangular stones that can be uneven.

At low tides Discovery Rock might be accessible over the rock and mud seafloor. The Delta Victoria Ocean Point Hotel borders the parkland and has many beautiful flower displays. Tuzo Rock is just off shore. And a lovely small sandy beach can be found on the east side of Songhees Point at low tides.

Built: 1885
To: Charles & Matilda Thomson

ARCHITECTURE:
2 storey Italian
Known for many years as the Dingle House Restaurant, it was attributed to John Teague, although there is no evidence that he was the architect. It was built for Charles William and Matilda Ringler Thomson, who lived in it until their death in 1916. Charles, or ‚ÄúGasworks Thomson‚Äù as he was affectionately called, was born in London, England, in 1827. He left in 1859 for the Gold Rush in California, ended up on Vancouver Island and became a mule trader, supplying pack animals in the Cariboo. In 1860, Charles married Matilda Midwinter in San Francisco. Matilda was born in Kent, England, in 1823. The couple came to Victoria and Charles became secretary and eventually manager of the newly formed Victoria Gas Co (502 Pembroke St., Burnside).

Great service even with so much rush at the peak hour.The jeans i was looking for (and it said were in stock online at this location) only had size 00 & 20 - basic black skinny jean. Not one of the staff offered help, walked past me a few times.

Previously, I brought my teen son in, and no one helped us on the floor or at the change rooms with sizes - or asked how my son was doing in the change room. I emailed the store & never heard back.I shop here because I have to, its one of the few places anyone over the size of 14 can shop. The prices are incredibly expensive for the fast fashion they area, and you are at a whim to whats in style. I wish they sold more basics that didn't come pre-ripped.Thanks justine for a good quick talk!

Kept asking us to collect the hangers after we tried on clothes. You have store associates to help sort clothes, don't expect customers to go picking up hangers. She needs basic training on talking to customers. It was on a Monday at 3pm.I will start off by saying, I get crazy anxiety when I have to go pants shopping-I avoid it at all costs unless I absolutely need to. It was one of those times yesterday and I was dreading a trip to the mall. I had gone into several stores and none of them had quite what I was looking for, and I was starting to get overwhelmed. I‚Äôve gotten nice professional pants from Reitmans before so I decided to stop in as my last effort before I gave up. They had exactly what I was looking for! Best of all, there wasn‚Äôt a crazy hassle to get into the change rooms, the staff were super friendly and easygoing. Often times when shopping in retail stores I feel like an inconvenience to the workers but this was not the case at all here! I even worked up the courage to ask them if they had the pair I was buying in a different colour in my size, and while they didn‚Äôt have it in store they offered to order me a pair and have it shipped right to me!! I left feeling more than happy with my shopping trip. Thank you to the lovely staff who helped me have such a comfortable experience :)I wear Plus Size clothing - a size range that is becoming harder and harder to find as stores close out and change their clothing focus to smaller sizes. I was trying to find a top to wear to my mother's Celebration of Life in 3 days. I did a quick round of the store and picked a half dozen different possibilities that I needed to try on. I don't buy clothing on-line as finding the right fit is very challenging and I don't buy anything without trying it on first. I was heading towards the fitting rooms only to be told in a snippy manner that the Fitting Rooms were closed as it was nearing the end of the day and they needed to be cleaned. It was 25 minutes before the closing time. There was one other customer in the store. Ummm....in a time where brick and mortar stores are shutting down because of lack of sales in person and people shifting to on-line purchases, this is pathetic customer service. Reitmans was once a great place to shop for Plus Size clothing but the experience that I've had at this location means I will never step foot in this store again!I had poor customer service this evening when trying to return an item. The woman was very condescending to my request when a little empathy would have gone a long way. I understand there are policies and procedures, but you don't need to be rude about it.I walked into this store today (Monday). It was quiet. There were 3 associates talking to each other.  None of them were greeting any of the customers including myself, that were walking into the store. I Stayed in the store, for at least 30 minutes. One of the Associates came  beside me to sort out the racks. She still did‚Äôt acknowledge my presence as a customer.

Then, I when went to one of the Associates  to check out the price of all of the items.  She was not very friendly at all.

The salesperson #888888 who processed my items was friendly but still, this store needs to train their associates to be more Customer focused."

There seemed to be plenty of size small and medium items in stock but few items size large and no sizes above a large. In this day and age, I would expect shops and brands to be more size-inclusive.Love this store so much. It was my first time going into this store today, but they have great quality clothes,  affordable pricing and what‚Äôs  more, super nice and helpful staffs! Although it was extremely busy there while I was trying, staffs are really helpful to give me advise about the style and the size. I was not sure which size to try so I got  lots items in wrong sizes, but the staff checked in with me while I was in fitting room, and got all correct sizes for me immediately. I am so impressed by their customer service. Sometimes I feel some boutiques are kinda pushy or not helpful at all, but at this store, I felt staffs are truly kind and helpful. I definitely recommend this store.The clothes here are beautiful, good quality and fairly priced. The main reason for the glowing review is the costumer service, the manager went above and beyond for me after I found an issue with one piece I bought. Definitely turned me into a repeat customer.I love their selection, the styles were all me!  Sometimes difficult to find a particular size because they don‚Äôt overbuy.  Staff was very helpful and attentive.I shopped at Spank on Saturday to find a dress to wear to an upcoming wedding. Although the store had many options, I left before I had tried them all on due to the rude, fat-shaming nature of the employee working the change room. When my mother commented that she didn't like one of the dresses I tried on, the change room employee agreed saying ""I was going to say, you look a bit heavy...""  Afterwards, I was trying on a dress and the employee insisted I try it in another colour. Through the door I could hear her calling to her coworker across the store to find the other dress saying repeatedly ""No, she needs a size large. A large! She needs a large!!""  She had not asked me what size I needed, just assumed, and I had to correct her through the door, saying ""No I am a medium."" These comments made me uncomfortable and self-conscious. Even if she didn't have ill-intent I think it is undeniable that this behaviour is inexcusable and unacceptable, especially by a complete stranger when someone is in the vulnerable state of trying on clothes (I did not ask for her opinion in the first place lol). I am not an overweight person and I am finally confident and happy with my body after years of struggle, yet this employee made me feel extremely insecure by her use of the word 'heavy', assumptions about what size I wear and the shouting of that size across the store. I worry about how someone who is plus-size or struggling with body image issues or an eating disorder would feel after an encounter with this employee. So disappointing."

The staff was friendly and super helpful focused on finding a solution to save me another trip to the store. Excellent customer service and will shop there again based on my first impression/experience with them!!I was truly disappointed when I went to take back some clothing I had purchased for my 86 year old mom. Before she could try them on (she's in a wheelchair) she ended up in hospital. Post going home I became ill and couldn't go to see her to assist with trying on clothing. I called the store just before 30 day refund notice was due *as I wouldn't be able to make the deadline. The clerk said no problem - they would work it out if it was only a few days. I went in 8 days late and was told no refund at all. Just store credit. There was zero compassion or empathy. just kept my money and issued me a gift card for the amount - over $200. My mom can't shop there as their clothing doesn't work for her - except for 2 pairs of pull up pants.
I will not be recommending Penningtons to anyone. The service was cold and uncaring.I give the Victoria Pennington's location a full 5 stars for their consistent, excellent customer service.  I've shopped here for many years, and the ladies who work here are always friendly and very helpful. My visit yesterday was no exception... top-notch service!
Clothing selection and quality can be a bit hit-or-miss, but I've been pleased with most of my purchases.The last time I was here, the salesgirl embarrassed me. She did help me, as I was having trouble finding certain things in my size, but at the cash register she loudly asked what size I had chosen to get. I was embarrassed because there were strangers in earshot and I was buying highly personal things.

You'd think someone working in a plus-size store would realize that sizes would be a touchy subject. She could have just asked, ""Did you find what you needed?"" That would have been more discreet.Placed an order and and put in my address wrong as it was my auto correct called right away to fix the address and was told sorry there is a zero cancellation policy or cannot fix my address. I said I don‚Äôt want to cancel I just need my address fixed so my parcel doesn‚Äôt go to the wrong address and the customer service lady said sorry there is nothing I can do. So needless to say my parcel is going to go to the wrong address and I now have to wait for it to hopefully be returned and who knows how long that will take. So if you‚Äôre gonna order I wouldn‚Äôt do it online as this was my first time ordering online."

ChIJKVSWApF0j1QRwdPPCE0DW5s,Runway Fashions,5.0,48.4211263,-123.3664573,4,"I'm so happy I found this store and will definitely make it a priority to shop here each time I visit Victoria. The clothes here have that ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes them so much more interesting than any of the clothing you'd find in a standard brand name store. It could be a unique hemline, interesting collar, or gorgeous textile. The owner also has some of her own designs. But even better than the clothes is the service! I spent about an hour in the store with the owner who encouraged me to try things that I wouldn't have been able to put together myself and created a fabulous outfit! She has a great eye. She's also honest and fun to work with. Also, you'll never see anyone else with the same item because she only orders a few then when it's gone it's gone. I highly recommend this boutique.During a recent visit to the city, I bought a beautiful mockneck sweater that caught my eye in the window while walking by. The owner is so friendly and she stocks a gorgeous variety of pieces. A Greek designer that I would have never heard of otherwise made the top I bought. Lovely quality. Worth going into the store in person to check it out if you live in the city or are visiting!I love this store! Right up front I'll warn you though...there are not alot of sizes in the styles here so if you are over a size 12 I'm afraid this isn't the store for you. The lovely owner, who is always i the shop, is an extremely accomplished tailor/seamstress and you will see examples of her own creations around the store. She buys excellent quality, stylish but comfortable clothing in cottons, linens and good wools and you really have to look carefully because of you do, you'll find some incredible prices on clothes I've seen at Hughes (just about the most expensive women's store in  Victoria). The other beauty of this shop is that youre not going to see other people wearing the same thing because she may have only one or two of something. The brands change with the seasons but I bet most women will walk in here and find something to love. The owner is also honest about what will look good on you and pay attention because she will make you look pretty fabulous if you listen to her suggestions. She slso is generous in giving discounts at the end of the season so even if there is no ""sale"" sign in the window if it's February and she still has alot of stock left then she'll offer a generous discount if you like something. She's been in this odd location, in the mall right next to the entrance to the Conference Centre (and near Liberty coffee) for ten years and I think that shows she knows what shes doing because you could easily walk by the shop and miss it."

Best clothing store in Victoria.
Thank you so much.How have I waited this long to write a review for Smoking Lily?? This is my favorite shop in all of Victoria. They make small batches of screen printed clothing so everything you buy is incredibly unique and there is really no way you'll see anyone else wearing your adorable tunic dress (that has pockets!) or your amazing bee and flowers skirt around town. I have purchased several dresses, skirts, scarves, etc. from Smoking Lily and they are the go-to staples in my wardrobe. Cannot tell you how many compliments I have received and people asking where I get my clothes from. They also carry beautiful pottery and jewelry from local artists. The staff is wonderful, caring, and very helpful! They are always wearing Smoking Lily pieces so it's easy to get inspiration for outfits. I'm seeing some other reviews about their clothes being pricey... but you're paying for high quality fabric (amazingly soft cotton, stretchy linen, etc.), beautiful prints, and the uniqueness of their pieces.If you're visiting Victoria this store is a must for one of a kind finds. If you're a local, this is the place for zero waste, comfortable, flattering clothing and accessories. Locally made from start to finish, and such beautiful designs and prints. Don't miss it!Great service and I love that the clothes are made locally. They use high quality fabrics that are so comfortable!Adore this shop. Screen printed tees have great whimsical designs. You'll get plenty of compliments from people when you wear something from this shop."

The clothes are well made and yes, a bit pricey, but when it comes to business clothes, you get what you pay for.  All of the staff were absolutely brilliant, but Victoria went out of her way to make my experience (and my friend's) feel comfortable, beautiful, and heard - no matter your size.  Excellent all around and I will definitely be back!Me and my friend visited the Laura uptown yesterday,  we were searching for something really particular,  Samin helped us to find the perfect outfit for me and my friend.

And really appreciate LAURA CANADA for there amazing employees üëèThe staff are super friendly and were very helpful in finding me a prom dress that would suit my body type!
Thanks again!I went in to try a dress in the Uptown mall which I saw online for 222 on sale. The staff said she would order it to the store for me no need to order online.

2 weeks later I get a call ""Sorry this dress is now sold out."" I should have just ordered online from the start and not have taken her advice. Just unbelievable. I needed the outfit for a xmas party.I love the flexibility of booking a private shopping appointment. I did this in September and with Shannon's expertise and knowledge I was able to put together my Fall wardrobe without any stress. Shannon made the whole experience FUN!! I get so many compliments when I wear the clothes she picked for me. I highly recommend you book an appointment!
A month later I went back for my winter coat and again Shannon helped me out. From now on I'm just going to let her pick all my clothes....LOL!!"

Staff were so gracious and professionalThank you to Blue Sky for such a positive experience. When the sale item I ordered online could not be shipped as stock had run out, I received a telephone call offering to substitute a similar sale item, more expensive, at the same price. That item was then shipped immediately. A very positive customer experience.The ladies in the shop always take great care of you and the store generally has an uplifting atmosphere.

Knocking extremely loudly on me in the fitting room (without saying a single word) so much that you startle me just to ""check if someone is there"", is not only unprofessional but completely senseless. You could have just asked, gently knocked and followed it by a question, or looked at the bottom of the door to check if the room is occupied (the doors do not reach till the floor and you could easily see people's feet). Even the customer in the room next to me was scared from how aggressive it was. I also agree with the previous comments, there was at least 4 staff working and no one checked in at all (despite there being only a couple other customers).More than 50% of their lights were off. Adjacent stores no issue with lights. When I asked staff why more than 50% of their lights were off, they offered no explanation. It was dark, difficult to the see fashions and a very poor shopping experience. Why bother to have the doors open. Turn off all the lights
and you can save even more money on electricity and staff with customers.Awesome customer services..As i love to do window shopping so whenever I go to uptown I usually go in suzy too‚Ä¶They generally have various varieties of different outfits‚Ä¶however,there is a person named Snehjeet, She always have a smile on her face and help in finding the best suitable clothes for me.Good Vibes! they were friendly and helpful, especially the manager! and i had to write about her good work ethnics to the head office.

I would have stayed the whole day with Margo, she was the best part about Amelia Lee !!!!The over $200 purse I JUST bought from this store broke. It‚Äôs a large purse, I assumed it was strong enough to carry an iPhone, an iPhone charged me and small wallet and a key fob but I was wrong. The strap tore right off, my belongings went flying and now my phone is cracked and I can‚Äôt see the screen. I was told this bag was of good quality by the sales associate, she even said it was durable. I‚Äôm now out $200 and a less then a year old iPhone. Thanks !I don‚Äôt really understand this store. I mean I get what they are going for, love the concept of combining fashion, lifestyle and motherhood. They have a bit of everything but not enough of anything which would make me want to stop by to search for something. Honestly, local supplies are great I‚Äôm all for shopping local/ but every store within and in the proximity of the downtown core carries the exact same stuff, hires the same people to collaborates on something ‚Äúunique‚Äù, differentiates themselves by the little oddities they sell which actually are also sold down the street, located in funky heritage buildings, which really are in not in areas easily accessible for moms or children, probably not in well cared for buildings, do not cater to tourists whatsoever despite being in the tourist hub, and are all in all crummy areas in the city, try something new! Of the non local brands carried- plenty and evey store probably on lojo carry them too. A piece or two atleast. There‚Äôs a reason this city is known as the place where fashion doesn‚Äôt exist.I was surprised to see the boutique had relocated from Johnson St but this new location is excellent.

There were about 4 to 5 people on staff working yet no one greeted me, helped me, checked in on me on the change room, Etc. It was one of the most unprofessional settings I've ever seen, I do not understand how you can help customers by cranking the music and ignoring them. It's not a hard job to treat your customers with respect so they'll buy your items. I tried on several items and was going to make a purchase but due to my experience I did not and I will never return to this location again.Was there today to buy a few things. Service was TERRIBLE.

On more than one occasion I have stood in line on my lunch break to purchase things and have ended up leaving because the amount of time it takes them to serve one person is INSANE. I have never seen lazier or slower moving employees in my life. Today, after I finally got up to the counter, got acknowledged by the employee as wanting to pay, then he turned around and him and the other 3 employees stood leaning on the counter watching a security guard follow a shoplifter for a while, until I had to interrupt and politely ask if I could pay for my items so I can get back to work. If that was the first time it‚Äôs be one thing, but it‚Äôs like this every time unfortunately and quite frankly, it‚Äôs very disrespectful of other peoples time. Will not be back, you shouldn‚Äôt have to beg employees to let you purchase something in a clothing store.They have a very poor return policy. They won't provide a refund on anything, and for a large number of items they won't even give an in-store credit. Apparently this is written in small print on your receipt, which they hand you AFTER you have already made your purchase. Don't ever purchase anything from here unless you are absolutely, 100% certain that it is the right size, shape, colour, style, etc, of something that you are sure you want, because you will likely be stuck with it afterwards whether you change your mind or not. Or better yet, save yourself the worry and just go someplace else.I went into the store wanting to trade in a piece that i got in a size too small. I didn‚Äôt receive a receipt upon my purchase because they had ran out of paper. I later came in trying to trade in this piece for a larger size and the manager asked me for information which is reasonable. I had to show proof of my purchase through a bank statement which takes a while but she had rushed me and told me she was unwilling to look through purchases that I thought were the specific one. It was a lot unnecessary attitude that would‚Äôve all been avoided if the change rooms were being run and I didn‚Äôt have to wait a while to not even try on the clothing.My experience if I could give it 0 I would, the staff was no where to be found the whole time I was there. The store was not clean either. When I was checking out the lady in the photo was being extremely mean to the girl she was training. Was also being extremely rude to me and my friends when we were confused about something. I had, had enough so I told her she didn‚Äôt need to be so rude she laughed at me. I told the girl in training that she was super nice and was doing an amazing job and to have a nice day. As I was leaving the lady in the photo called me a ‚Äústupid c*nt‚Äù I had turned back and said that was not appropriate in a work place and I asked for her name and she wouldn‚Äôt give it to me so I took this photo she called me a bunch of other names I really don‚Äôt think that is appropriate for a work place I will not be coming back horrible experience I felt attackedMegan was extremely helpful during our visit today. We were trying to return an item from Urban Behaviour, and although she originally said we could not, she still wanted to confirm with her manager. He said we couldn‚Äôt, so she proceeded to assist us in finding other locations where we could make the return.

In the meantime, her manager called back after speaking to the district manager, and informed her she could in fact accept our return and give store credit.

Overall, she was helpful, patient, and a good customer service representative."

However customer service is lacking... people who work there don't engage with the customers... very robotic, only saying the sales and what is mandatory to say.I'm completely disappointed in the customer service here today, usually I love this place and bringing my friends there and reccomending this as a one stop shop but after today I will no longer.

I don't reccomend coming here unless you are okay with final sales even if clothings damaged by staff and you don't mind constantly not being told anything is a final sale/exchange only.

Diana is fabulous very knowledgeable and helpful. So is Sebastian. Truly most of staff is nice there. Probably because Kim, the manager trains them well.

Love the quality of their clothes.Jeans smell of mothballs after a first rinse in water. Multiple washings have not removed the stench. The manager had not heard of that before and only offered an exchange instead of a refund, so BR does not accept responsibility for defective products. A brief internet search reveals this mothball issue is a real thing. Will not buy there again, and I feel sorry for others who end up with the same problem. In the store there is no hint of mothball smell, it manifests only after you get homeTerrible service...
I ordered a couple things online under final sale.. loved them but that sizes were wrong and either the local store or online were willing to help. Refused to change the sizes for me and / or do a store credit.... no matter if it was ""final sale"", online ordering should always be subject to either option as the sizes specially at Banana Republic are not consistent.

I guess lesson learned... I was a regular shopper and this situation will for sure affect my shopping with Banana Republic.My experience at Banana Republic in the Mayfair Mall in Victoria today was less than pleasant. I was not properly greeted, no eye contact was made, and I felt shoved out of the way by staff and customers when i was trying to look at the merchandise. I won‚Äôt darken their doors again.Staff were great, I wish the sizing wasn‚Äôt so short though, mens fit used to be much better.

Cashier: Sofi and/or Associate: Taylor M, not sure which one but I have seen her there a few times while I shop and who ever it was had a horribly snobby attitude while she was ringing everything through. There is no reason for the horrible service I received from that one employee. As a store that sells fairly nice and pricey clothing the attitude of your employees should match exactly that! Thanks, I will make an extra trip to get the belt and it should not have been missed in the order the first or second time, seems like intentionally rude behavior. I hope the owner of the store takes better care of their employees so this doesn't have to happen to any customer, especially a regular....shameful!  At least the new girl was amazingly nice and helpful, along with the other lady helping me with dress sizes. Sometimes it's really great service, but the end of that shopping experience left a bad impression on customer service and satisfaction.Their selection has improved dramatically (for the better) over the last few years. It's an odd mix of brands carried rhough, you have $300+ quality denim brands and then poorly made $50+ sweaters that the store has carried forever for reasons I don't understand. The staff at this location make sure your never standing around with items your going to be trying on, if you have any questions they will most likely make it to you and ask if you need anything before you even realize you do.. that being said, (and not all of them) but quite a few of the girls are not exactly very polite, in fact some of them can be quite bluntly judgemental and give off a very unwelcoming and entitled (not sure to what) aura. It resulted in me associating the whole store with these negative interactions I experienced and have witnessed others experience as well,  It would be a much more satisfying experience if the employees who give off this impression be reminded that as employees they are meant to represent the company  and the brand's it carries, be that negative or positive it does reflect back onto the store.The customer service is questionable at the uptown location. The staff wasn't helpful and when I asked about professional wear. She pointed to a region and said you can find them in that region but all I saw were jeans and casual clothing. I guess maybe it's not the place for professional wear. But the staff, she could have told me sorry, we don't sell anything like that. Her attitude was surprisingly ignorant. I will never go in there again and I definitely prefer Zara more."

Lorna sources amazing lines and even helps to design pieces specifically to her client's tastes. Thanks for continuing to give us fabulous fashion right here in Victoria!I shopped on a Saturday night from the comfort of my own home. The website images inspired me cuz the owner is the real deal of a woman. She models her own clothes! I was looking for two summer tunics and found what I was looking for along with what I hoped would be perfect leggings. I sensed I could trust the sizing and images presented. So I placed my order. Then a box with a hand-written label addressed to me arrived on Wednesday the following week. When I opened the box, I was delighted to see that my expectations were met. Beautiful garments! And wrapped with care and attention to detail. Thank you Bodacious for being who you present yourself to be -- a celebration of the feminine in all her wisdom, elegance & beauty!

The woman working, who I‚Äôm assuming isthe owner, was immediately so warm, friendly, and personable. I pulled a pair of gorgeous linen pants on to try and she had me give her a little fashion show, it made me feel so special. She brought me so many other cute vintage and non vintage plus size pieces to try and was SO attentive. I felt like I was shopping with a friend. The other staff members were just as kind and sweet!

This shop is amazing and also so well curated and gorgeous. I highly recommend checking it out, even if it‚Äôs just so the very nice pretty ladies working there can share their positive energy with you. It really made my day and now I have a well made pair of pants I‚Äôll probably have for the rest of my life.

Thank you guys for making my day!!Folk is the best clothing store in Victoria -- hands down. The quality is excellent and the items are carefully selected for their aesthetic and clean silhouettes. As a busy, small-business owner, I don't have a lot of time to get dressed in the morning so I appreciate that anything I get at Folk I can throw on in the morning and instantly look professional, stylish and put together. I'm surprised to see people complain about prices -- as an adult, you look at a price tag and willingly walk to the cashier to buy something. If items are available in other places, i.e. online, posted prices often do not reflect shipping and customs, which can quickly jack up the price. (This recently happened to me with a jacket I bought online, and it increased the price of the jacket by 35%. In hindsight, I wished I had given that money to a local business instead of Canada Customs.) Additionally, the prices at other places do not reflect their culture. Buying something online to cut costs can mean that employees on that end are paid minimum wages, whereas at Folk the employees are local people with good jobs and happy smiling faces. If I want a $6 t-shirt, I'll go to H&M where my stepson shops. In the meantime, I'm a business professional and plan to continue giving to local businesses and looking fly while I do it. A pic of my favourite tunic is attached, which I got at Folk and for which people stop me on the street to ask where I got it every. single. time.Recently checked out this store for the first time while visiting Victoria with a friend. Lots of very cute minimalist pieces and a very pretty store overall. The main reason for my review is that the woman helping me was so fun and outgoing. I didn‚Äôt catch her name but she made my experience so amazing; I‚Äôve never felt so good going clothing shopping before! This woman is definitely an asset to the business and a natural salesperson.Bought an amazing vintage Escada dress here and I must say I
loved the vibe of the new location. Felt very warm and inviting. The owner Willow was super fun and very helpful and I felt very looked after as a client. It‚Äôs hard to find exceptional customer service these days and I felt the owner was beyond exceptional and that a lot of private stores in Victoria could learn from her example. Thank you again for an awesome shopping experience and a fabulous dress!LOVE the vibe of this beautiful shop. The owner and all her staff are pure magic. Its incredible to walk into such an amazing space, and get this? THEY ACTUALLY SAY HI TO YOU WHEN YOU ENTER!! So important in my opinion. I love the mixture of vintage clothes, what a smart idea. The owner is always a dream to speak too, and AWAKE non the less. Which in these ""fake woke"" days is VERY HARD to come by. I will absolutely be back and so looking forward to the next time....ALSO, what is with people complaining about no refunds? lol what planet do you live on that you think refunds are just given to you by a small business, IT'S ALWAYS IN STORE CREDIT. So stop your btchin' trolls, these woman are incredible. If you don't dig where the clothes are made, stop trolling and kindly shop elsewhere. Needed to get that off my chest as BULLY'S and me DO. NOT. VIBE. I will absolutely be back"

Cute clothes .Both staff member on their phones and no regard to help at all .. worst customer service around . Highly recommend evaluating your staff some major coaching opportunities. Do better  .I don‚Äôt usually take the time to write reviews but I stopped in here quickly yesterday to buy my daughter some jeans. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of time to search so I asked the little reddish brown haired sales associate to help me. I admit I was a little pushy but I was in a rush. The associate was balancing phone calls and other customers but never once did I feel I was an inconvenience. Not only was I assisted in getting the perfect pair of jeans but the one on one service I received was great. I will definitely stop in with my family next time we are on Vancouver island.Would put 0 stars if I was able too, worse customer service ever ! 2 of them just sat around till.

Every time I‚Äôve been here the customer service is lacking. No one ever greets you, asks if you need a room or are friendly at all. My sister bought a dress here and wore it for a few hours and then the next morning wanted to wear it again, and there was already a hole in it. Cheap quality and bad service, will be skipping it from now on.I discovered this store today and I absolutely fell in love!  They have great selection and very welcoming, energetic staff ! I‚Äôll be back!Flavour downstairs has some good selection and reasonable prices. Flavour upstairs (vintage) is an absolute miss. It seems as though their entire collection is based on an 80 year old lady named Geraldine. A lot of the staff seem to embody that, with a general vibe of 'get off my lawn' instead of welcoming customers in. Many items are priced more expensive than their retail price... I'd say stick to downstairs storefront or avoid altogether.They've done a great job of curating their clothing and the prices are all fair. Really funky clothing and great customer service. I had a really good experience with a girl named Lily who made our day! She was very kind and went out of her way to help us out.I used to avoid this store because they carry a variety of brands and the sizing can be a bit of a nightmare if you're a curvier person like me.

The staff that are at this location now are very laid-back and approachable people. I really enjoyed my last visit and bought a gift for a friends birthday, and was pleasantly surprised when the sales associate helped me wrap the earrings and ensure it was ""gift ready"".

Very helpful lady. A but pricey.I went into the Hillside Suzanna‚Äôs this evening. The assistant asked me if I needed help to which I replied that I was just browsing. The assistant then responded in a disgruntled tone that she should charge everyone that comes into browse. So I turned around and walked back out again. No wonder the shop was empty. They need to work on customer service.I have worked in this store as a sales associate and the managers were racist and impolite to me and other previous sales associate. Also, the whole store is  TRASH!
Do not waste your money.I have been here a couple of times now and I always seem to find something. Could have had one more sales person so while one was helping the other could have watched the cash register. It seems a sale was missed and it upset the ONLY sales person.

Plus, when I got home, my daughter adored the top like I knew she would! Great store, great service.Everyone at Ricki's Hillside is so upbeat, helpful, and friendly. I always love going in there. And mostly I find some great new item at a decent price. The pants especially fit me well. I think by now 90% of the pants I own come from Ricki's. Thanks, team!One Saturday afternoon, I popped in to Ricki's to return an online purchase.  I usually don't love going to stores these days finding it difficult to get help...often finding unengaged staff. This was not the case at Hillside.  Browsing, I was asked by two different employees if they could assist or start a change room for me.  Once I did try something on, the staff was super helpful and cheerful!  Regan at check out was great and completed my experience on a high note.  You have the most amazing team in this store and I will be sure to return -- thank you!As always I find something I am looking for when I go to Ricki's Staff were so helpful and made sure it was the correct size and look and for me.

Again, thank you!I've heard a lot about this new store from my friends and decided to give it a try. I have been to other mid to high-end boutiques in Europe and, to be honest, I didn't expect to see anything even close to those European stores that I visited. To my huge surprise, this store impressed as soon as I stepped in. Very bright and stylish and at the same time inviting and comfy. You can see the store owners put a lot of work and love in this place.

In addition to the store design, I was taken back with the clothes selection and how it's tastefully organized on the rack and the shelves. Kudos to Natalie and Maria!

And what a service! These girls treated me as VIP and for this short period of time I was given some beautiful choices for outfits and also the style that would suite me the best.
It's definitely not your ordinary store. I'll be back for more shopping!I had a fantastic experience here. The lady at the shop was so warm and helpful; she picked out some great options that I wouldn‚Äôt have picked myself.

And then the other girl next to her said ‚Äúit‚Äôs annoying when they want to check after you have to rip them off‚Äù.Had the BEST experience shopping here on April 4th with Micaila. She went ABOVE & BEYOND to help me for over an hour , made my experience stress free , and so pleasant . She took the time to actually listen to what I truly needed , why , what I felt comfortable In; and made some great suggestions for me . She was so personable, genuine and it was such a great shopping experience .  I‚Äôve been an aritzia customer for a loooong time and this was by far one the the best experiences I have ever had .Super unprofessional, had a sign outside saying they were hiring so I went in to speak to the hiring manager, she didn't even come out to see me she just gave someone her card to give to me.

I then had an interview a week later and it was in the middle of the shopping mall sat next to loads of people which was awkward and super loud.

Rebecca the interviewer seemed nice, she said I would most likely have a second interview and she'd be in touch. But I never heard from her again and when I asked for some feedback as I assumed i didn't get the job she just ignored me. Really unprofessional just be up front and honest and say rather than making people wait and wonder. There's a stereotype with aritzia workers and that whole process confirmed that.Fantastic service, I appreciate the always helpful Robin and her attention to my style and needs. Aritzia Mayfair is my #1 for clothes shopping in Victoria. Love this storeI don‚Äôt normally leave reviews but Mikayla‚Äôs service was really great.

I came into the Hillside store 3 yrs ago, and that was the last time I looked for anywhere else to buy jeans. Every time I have gone in, within seconds I was greeted by a staff member, and asked if they could help me.
After the first purchase, which was my best jean purchase in my life, I now just walk in and say, this is what I am looking for.
A staff member will take me right to what I need and show me any variations that are available. Usually there is a good sale going on too.
I would recommend this store to any middle aged man who is looking for nice looking, nice fitting jeans, without having to deal with some store that has no time for you, because they are too busy listening to their music loudly, or texting with friends.
Thank you for excellent service.The staff was super friendly and helpful!! Love that storePleasant service, associate knew her products, I had to exchange jeans for different style ,not a problem,bought another garment.I have always had great service at this location, but I went in today and the blonde lady working was all but helpful. She disregarded my presence in the store and had an extremely negative tone when talking to other customers. I will not be back!This place has great deals on clothing especially when they have their cleatance sales. The mens clothing I have bought for others has been very nice quality at a good price.

The items I purchased in December 2021 will be relegated to gardening gear  by summer. Truly disappointed customer.The staff are friendly and always ensure that I receive any discount that's possible even if it isn't in effect until the next day.

I have things in my closet from Talbots that are 20 years old and still look great.  The quality has declined.  On my visit today the clerk was impatient and rude and the store wasn't busy.  I miss the ""old"" Talbots.I love visiting this store when I visit Victoria.  The clothes are fashionable, flattering, comfortable, and very well made. The store has a lovely welcoming atmosphere.  When browsing, I couldn't help but smile at the banter taking place between the staff and the customers.  And when they have a sale it is like no other...talk about indulging in retail therapy!

I mainly worked with John, who was so knowledgeable and helpful and made sure I was happy with how my suit fit. I went around to a bunch of stores looking for menswear, but consistently ended up back at Outlooks for my entire look for the day (including belt, shoes, and shirt). A great curated selection of menswear with very helpful staff! Thanks John!Absolutely wonderful experience! John helped me craft the most amazing suit for my wedding. It was my first time getting something tailored, and John made it a fun and collaborative experience. The end result was the most spectacular outfit I‚Äôve ever owned, beautifully arranged and perfectly fitted.

The whole team was extremely helpful every step of the way and made the whole process very approachable. Going to Outlooks was worth every penny! I‚Äôll definitely be back if I ever need another suit.My partner and I went in looking for a suit for his sisters wedding. The customer service was awful... we left feeling so incredibly uncomfortable. We walked in and were not greeted, walked around for five minutes without having anyone acknowledge us, and then had to approach a worker in order to be helped (as someone who has worked in retail, I would consider the store to be not busy at this point). The gentleman that ""helped"" us seemed annoyed with our questions, did not give suggestions and/or help us to find other options, did not smile once and essentially just glared at us the whole time, and overall just created a very awkward and uncomfortable interaction. I saw other workers helping customers in a genuine and caring way while giving suggestions/feedback, however, we were not treated with the same level of service. Considering we are going to be paying $700+ for a suit, I would expect better.I have been happy with the quality of clothing and the customer service at both the downtown and uptown locations.  Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and I‚Äôve always been treated well. Definitely my first stop in town whenever I need a new suit or tieOther reviewers have captured the calibre of the styles and designs available for a variety of occasions.

Aside from this, I'd like to note that the customer service has been exemplary in each of my visits. The staff is knowledge on the fashionable pairings, trends, material and care for the products suggested.

Regardless of who's attending to me (sales staff, Tailor, etc.), I feel valued, respected and that my business is appreciated. I recommend this business without any hesitation, they are a lovely neighbour and wish them continued success."

A real pleasure to shop here.Amazing selection of unique beautiful clothes that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else. Pants that actually fit my body and look flattering! That‚Äôs a first. A must visit. Super friendly warm service.I had the pleasure of visiting this sweet little shop when I was in town on vacation a few weeks ago and I LOVED IT! The shop owner was very warm and friendly and you could tell that this store was a passion project for her. We shared quite a few laughs together as I tried on nearly everything in the store. I loved the unique selection of clothing and accessories, as it was different from the usual boutique brands. I left with quite a few purchases and a well-used credit card, and I can't wait to go back!!! Definitely check out The Standout in Oak Bay!!!The owner is so helpful and amazing, the products are very unique"
ChIJlbToxJp0j1QRlYWTHUBG9rM,Below the Belt,3.7,48.425179,-123.3675171,51,"I visited recently and I found the employee with the short hair/ buzz cut super cold. They didn‚Äôt help any customers and when I went up to the till to pay they just stood facing the other way and another employee had to come help me. They also never seemed to help any of the other staff who were working hard and thankfully were helpful while I was there.I came into the store to try on some jeans (something I dread) and I'm so happy that I was assisted by Philip! He was so knowledgeable and kind. He asked me what type of fit I was looking for and advised me on how different Levi's would stretch a size over time. I'm so happy be recommended sizing down in Levi's Wedgies (with 1% elastane) because they certainly did relax in the seat and thighs.
He recommended different styles and I ended up buying three pairs. I'm so happy with how they fit and was incredibly impressed with Philip's help and attention.
Next time I look for jeans, I will stop by Below The Belt first and peek in to see if Philip is working! A rockstar employee! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠êHorrible customer service. No greeting during the whole time in store. 2 associates just chatting to each other. When I asked questions, very minimal cold answers. Brands in store are nice but definitely not their staffs.My first experience in this store today was an absolute 5 star experience, and all thanks to a staff member who definitely deserves recognition. Phillip greeted me quickly upon entering the store! He was very well dressed, kind, and approachable. He spent so much time helping me find the perfect pair of Levi's jeans and I honestly probably would have gotten overwhelmed and left without a purchase had he not helped me find exactly what I need.  He held up a conversation in a casual and comfortable way which had me feeling like I was shopping with a good friend and not just being helped by an employee. That is something that would have me coming back just to have that level of service.

If there's one thing we all can agree on it's that finding a perfect pair of jeans is like finding a needle in a haystack. Thanks to Phillips that became an easy and pleasant experience. ‚ù§Ô∏èI walked in looking for some clothing and was assisted horribly. Customer service wasn‚Äôt helpful at all in any way and I noticed the work environment was not friendly to its workers"

Went into the store to just browse and ended up purchasing some jeans all because of the service from Dawson and Johnathon. Dawson went above and beyond finding the unusual size I needed. I am definitely going to be making Plenty for Men the first stop if I need to search for some mens clothing. Thanks very much for a great shopping experience. You don't get that very often any more.I enjoy shopping in Plenty women for myself and at Plenty Men for male members of my family.
This afternoon I went into the men‚Äôs store at Uptown Mall and noticed that 2 of the 3 male employees were wearing their masks below the nose.  We all know that it sucks that we are still having to wear masks, however we are still in the midst of a Pandemic and some people are doing their best to avoid getting sick.
I politely asked that the 2 guys wear their masks properly and they did so without a problem.  I feel that I should not have to ask, however.
The employees are a reflection of the integrity of the store management and if they are not wearing masks properly it speaks volumes about how much they do or don‚Äôt respect the public.  I felt you would want to know about this.
Other than this the service was great.

Thank you.Men can get some snazzy clothing here and one stop shop for it too. Excellent prices and staff are helpful. Not to be missed.I went there it was the best experience from a clothing store I‚Äôve been to designer shops and the people at Plenty blew them out the water for service and helping me choose clothes  10/10 I highly recommend going there.

They are clearly looking for specific pieces or brands as they are so full, why not communicate what they are looking for.
Also the pricing especially in this economy made me feel sick. I found at least 4 pieces I currently own and paid less for new on sale. I understand we all need to make money but have some decency.
This could be a wonderful little shop but seriously needs a vibe check.I knew to expect higher prices since it‚Äôs consignment/curated but wow $20+ for a used plain black Gildan t-shirt is what to expect here. I guess those high prices can‚Äôt pay for an adequately sized cage for their two birds shoved into one very tiny cage together.

The only credit to them is they have cool pieces and the window displays are fair advertisements to what‚Äôs insideBest Clothing store in town! The people that work there are super sweet and caring! Best clothes at a great price... would definitely check it out if in the area!A few years ago I walked into pocket clothing with my partner and the lady who runs the store was very friendly and helpful. She sold me a pair of Louboutin high heels for $80 and assured me they were genuine. Along with it, I bought an Ecote handbag she told me was real Indian red leather. Turns out, years later when I went to inquire about my items, I was told they were fake. And the handbag was Urban Outfitters I believe. They were both fakes and I felt she took advantage of me and my partner being we were coming out of homelessness at the time. I mean, its one thing to make a sale and another to mislead a person into thinking they're buying something authentic when they're told so. Won't be returning, just to post this review to warn others.Super cool place with great curation of alternative and fashionable options. I admire the window display everytime they change it - which is often! Seems I always want something in the window!! I've got some of my coolest and most unique clothing items from here.

Amazing selection of brands and helpful staff definitely the place to go after a big pay day.Entitled ownership and management that do not display in a clear and visible manner anywhere in their store, the fact that they do not do cash refunds. During my attempt at a return for a refund I reminded the cashier that I asked my salesperson during the purchase about a return, and was told that it was. Management then comes to explain to you that what his salesperson really meant the day before was - that a return is never for your hard earned cash back, but rather for this stores small print tucked away hidden policy of an in-store credit only. Poor!

Four Horseman Management - Your reply to my review is a joke!
Your attempt at trying to falsely flip the narrative and remove the focus of my NEGATIVE review from your HIDDEN no cash refund policy - to false claims about my behaviour is insulting to all those who read reviews. Your character in this regard only further undermines your business practices & credibility - from boutique to garage sale - buyer be ware!The staff are always so nice and helpful, even if you are not buying anything.

I wouldn‚Äôt call myself a picky eater, but I‚Äôm not very adventurous when eating at restaurants, so I usually order a meal I‚Äôm familiar with and know I‚Äôll enjoy. I ended up ordering the tasting menu because I wanted to try items I wouldn‚Äôt regularly order and I‚Äôm happy to say each plate turned out amazing. Special shout-out to the cheeseburger because it was DELICIOUS. Every detail was spot on; the bun, sauce, crispy cheese, and juicy patty.My partner and I came in to a fun filled kitchen/seating area for I had an incredible evening at Hank's. I sat at the bar with my friend and ordered the tasting menu paired with wine. What an experience!

The amount of food was perfect. The selection was very diverse and delicious. There will be pictures of each dish, so check them out! By far, my favorite dish was the elk leg and mushrooms.

Our chef explained each dish in detail, so I will spare my attempt at doing that and say that if you go, I'd reccomend sitting at the bar. He is very inspired and passionate about his craft. We were lucky the owner was there to bring each glass of wine to life!

I'm very much looking forward to returning for another incredible evening.

Thank you everyone at Hank's for putting love into what you do!I remember clearly as a small
child that the ‚Äúbest‚Äù things came in small packages. If you are one of the lucky ones to get inside this Victoria Gem called  ‚ÄúHank's *A Restaurant‚Äù , then you‚Äôve just won the lottery of an experience like no other.

We ordered and shared the Walnut and Arugula pesto & the Cheeseburger with potato fries . Each bite was like the first time you experienced Disneyland for the first time . Clark , the Culinary Artist  and part owner,  personally checked to see how our meals were. His attention to detail and passion for his craft is why we will return to experience many of the other incredible menu items .

We hadn‚Äôt even finished our first meal experience, and we were already talking  about what we‚Äôd order next time.

A true Victoria Gem definitely worth experiencing !Here for a quick trip to Victoria and wow walking by saw this little gem. It‚Äôs an absolute must! We ordered the squash, the meatballs and the steak.  The taste, presentation and flavours were out of this world! Completely impressed, it‚Äôs quaint and perfect for a group of 3 , a single or a romantic couple we shared each dish and it was a perfect portion! Unbelievable üéâüéâüéâ far exceeded any expectations! This is a must eat here spot!

The staff recommended ‚ÄúCrab Cake Eggs Benedict.‚Äù We both went with her recommendation. Wow, she was on point! Rich, tasty and melt in your mouth. Hubby loved it so much he ordered it again the next morning. The next morning I ordered ‚ÄúAll Canadian breakfast‚Äù as I love scrambled eggs and chose rye bread, bacon and substituted potatoes with fruit.

I have to say the staff is amazing - attentive, genuine and down-to-earth.

Great breakfast to fuel us for the day full with walking. We ended up needing to walk off the wonderful meal along the harbour. Not a bad start to a day, eh!Dropped in for a nightcap and between my husband and I we had 6 delicious drinks.  I asked for a espresso martini which was not on the menu and they delivered it with a smile. Sandeep was very knowledgeable about the drinks that was served and made us feel at home. The bartender really is outstanding at his profession as well as quick.  And the restaurant itself is very clean, cozy, and esthetically pleasing to the eye.We dined here for breakfast twice during our recent stay at the Marriott. The food was quite tasty and the service was even better! I can‚Äôt remember our waitress‚Äô name but she was super friendly, funny and efficient. I would say it‚Äôs a little on the expensive side, especially for breakfast.

Hubby had the omelette both days and enjoyed it. I had the cinnamon French toast one day and the sandwich the other day. Both were good!I've been very fortunate to be able to try a wide variety of menu options and everything seems to be excellent quality.

The crab cakes eggs benny is a must try!
Very flavorful crab cakes topped with sliced avocado and a perfectly poached egg, tasty potatoes on the side and a creamy and zesty hollandaise sauce to pour over top.

Buffalo chicken wings were thickly breaded and really delicious.

The seafood chowder was filled with yummy bites.

The french toast was amazing! It had so much flavour on it's own but then it was paired with fruits and a cinnamon whip on the side, you hardly have a need for any syrup.

The Reuben was juicy and not overly salty as others can be.

The calamari was a bit odd and the least flavorful thing I tried.

The steak was my absolute favourite dish, perfectly cooked with a delicious flavoured butter and nice crust on the outside and rich sauteed mushrooms.

The fish and chips were exactly what you'd expect and they do have good fries.

The cappuccino chocolate terrine dessert was nice and rich without being overly sweet, despite it missing the raspberry sauce as advertised. The chocolate was smooth and the almond bark on top was crunchy. I'm not actually sure where the cappuccino flavour is meant to be but I'm an espresso addict so I tend to not be able to taste coffee flavours unless they are overly pronounced.This was an incredible experience and I thoroughly enjoyed myself and so did my company. You must try this. Fun for all ages. I wish them all the success . What an amazing concept"

No. But the consistency of food and service would certainly bring me back again!Ordered off a deliver app and the ribs I got were a bit dry. I called moxies and asked if anything could be done. They gave me a few options and remade my meal. It‚Äôs delicious and the ribs are perfect!

They went above and beyond with their customer service and even added a brownie bite I was not expecting.

Thank you moxies for the great customer service and really good food! I will be back :)Consistent and delicious. If you have the time I recommend. Brea is a sweetheart. Ribs, Gyoza  and calamari/shrimp tempura are always good appetizers. Salmon is always nicely cooked it Medium or medium well they cook it medium rare. Steak, mushrooms, mash, gravy and beef dip were all really nice options.September 2/21 visit: happy hour Red Sangria $6 and Dry Ribs $10; ribs order quite large, took half home.

The Prawn Tagliatelle ($23.75) comes with a slice of garlic toast. The nicely presented entree was delicious, one of the best pasta dishes I've had. Especially like the capers in the sauce, and on the garlic toast it's like the best bruschetta ever.

Service was quick, the atmosphere lively (bit on the noisy side) and busy.

They are training new hosts and servers; servers Tony and Heather were great.
Busy place, fine food, good service!

January 15, 2021 visit:
Good experience, nice atmosphere but little noisy. Busy on a Saturday evening.
Sirloin steak was done just right, lots of veggies - almost too much! The food was nicely seasoned and nicely presented.
Only issue - the steak knife was not very sharp.

Staff were professional, not overly friendly but made me feel welcome.

Reservations recommended for preferred seating of groups of three or more. Prices are comparable to similar dining options, e.g., Earl's, Cactus Club, Joey. Staff seem nicer, though."

Must visit when in Victoria.One of the few places which have decent options for vegetarians! The staff is amicable and made us feel very comfortable. We ordered mushroom skillets, curried penne and vegetarian lasagna. Mushroom skillet was delicious and better than expectations. Curried penne wasn‚Äôt great, but the vegetarian lasagna was amazing!! We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and had a satisfying meal. Would definitely visit more to check out the other dishes.Frankie's is a must go if you are visiting Victoria, the location is perfect as you will definitely find yourself walking up and down Government street and the diner is just there.

The menu is vast and cover much, if not all, you'd expect a dinner to serve. The food has always been amazing on every visit and the service very friendly and welcoming.

If you find yourself lost on so many options, go for the mimosas, classic burger with fries and a slice of that amazing key lime pie."

Five stars should be memorable, flawless, clean, etc. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs any of those things. But if you‚Äôre looking for a $7.50 breakfast plate, it‚Äôll be fine.

I don‚Äôt recommend the eggs Benny.This unassuming little hideaway in the commercial district of Victoria offers the fast solution for the ""working man's"" appetite. Burgers, sandwiches and an all day breakfast seem to the mainstay of this establishment plus the constant flow of customers picking up take out orders. The portions are always on the larger side just by looking at what orders were nearby. I ordered an omelette and it was ok, nothing special. The decor would have been appropriate for the 70's but the food arrives fast. Order at the counter and self serve for coffee. I'd go back.Love Love Love this place. Food is amazing and so are the owners. Best place to grab lunch and you can pre order via a phone call for pickup. Bring cash, there is no credit cards accepted here. Menu is reminiscent of old style soda shops and the comfort food is bang on."

Even tho it was mothers day and we didn't had reservation they were able to give us a table. We got a nice table with harbor view. My favorite was bloody merry with pineapple, shrimp, mozzarella and kabanos. We had a quick lunch while exploring city during our cruise stop at Victoria. Lovely island with lovely parks and scenery.
I took mushroom soup which was too bland for me but spinach artichoke dip and my husbands tacos were excellent. Price was very good as well.  Service was very quick.Restaurant looked super busy but was able to be sat in less than 5 minutes. Fast service and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.

Fish Tacos with Fries, Sweet & Fire Cauliflower, Margarita, Peach Bellini were all delicious.

Food was fresh and drinks were strong!  Plenty of outdoor seating. Family friendly, close to the water. Highly recommend if your in the area.Enjoyed Happy Hour at Milestones Grill + Bar on the famed Victoria Harbour. Fortunate to get an outdoor table on a beautiful summer day. The food and service were excellent and thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos and bloody Mary's. The location is also hard to beat with all the energy of harbour life including sailboats, water taxis, seaplanes, cruise ships, power boats, tourists and sidewalk vendors. Well worth checking it out!Delicious food, and excellent staff. We went to Victoria for our 14th anniversary, and chose Milestones for a romantic dinner. The atmosphere wasn't as romantic as we had hoped, but the other diners seated around us seemed like they were having a wonderful time, and it really helped boost our mood. We liked it so much, we went back the next day for brunch while we waited for the ferry.The staff were attentive to our large group despite it being a busy night for them, and the food was some of the best restaurant food I've had in awhile. I had my baby with me and they were able to provide a high chair and bring water for his bottle when I needed it.
This restaurant has some really fun cocktails and lots of choice on their menu for a special night out. The view of the harbour was a lovely addition to a great meal. This restaurant would be a good choice for a party or date."

Super cool concept here.  Nice room, great staff, food is fantastic.

The family style meal is what brings it home for me (no pun intended).  Let's you enjoy so much more than just your meal... really love this!

I can't wait to go back and enjoy the omakase-like experience where the chef prepares a sampling of their menu items - I can't wait to get back!

Add this to your must-visit list... you won't regret it.Went for dinner with our great friends and we had a great time.  We had the chef's selections and what a fantastic choice. I'm sure it changes frequently but from the salad to main course and the dessert were all fantastic. I would highly recommend the place. Just make sure you go on an empty stomach. It's filling. And make sure if you're going on weekend evenings to make a reservation.This quiet but trendy restaurant tucked downstairs in a brick building had wine racks everywhere and twinkly candles .  The menu was ‚Äútasting style‚Äù meaning easy to share the plate , and the food was very tasty. Everything was totally fresh and deliciousWe were visiting from Ontario, and had heard good things about this place, and were really excited about it. Unfortunately, it really didn't meet the expectations that we had.

We ordered the potatoes, the ricotta toast and squid. To their credit, nothing we ordered was bad, but it also wasn't great, and for the price point, I'm not sure I would pay for that again.

Their drinks are pretty neat, and were delicious. I think if I were to recommend this place, I would to someone going for a drink + snack, or a great first date place. However, if you were looking for dinner, I would probably pass. Just my 2 cents.4.5 starts with this food quality can‚Äôt believe. Every food was taste burnt except pasta. Steak was awful taste and salmon was dry no taste on it. Overall had a really bad experience. $75 steak could something top notch. This can be a Bar not a restaurant. üëéüèøüëéüèøüëéüèø"
ChIJIShj8Jp0j1QRcsWjkgzn4ac,Little Jumbo Restaurant and Bar,4.5,48.42527,-123.36928,1192,"Excellent bar with sophisticated cocktails. Perfect fancy date night bar. As a tourist, I went out of my way to find a non-tourist cocktail bar and they delivered. They have an eclectic and extensive assortment of spirits. Knowing it was dedicated to historic bar masters I had high hopes, but it truly exceeded my expectations. Anytime I'm back in Victoria I'll be visiting again.My first time eating here was for my birthday. I had read the reviews and had some friends talk about their experience.

Over all not a bad experience. we were seated at the bar, was able to watch the bartenders make cocktails. Service was good, it did take a while to have our order taken.

Although the food was good, I did find the price a bit high based on what was received. I understand a lot of factors go into building the price list, I just thought for a spot that is claimed to be one of the best in YYJ, my expectation was higher than what was received.Came to this restaurant after our wedding to celebrate as I‚Äôve heard good things, even our wedding commissioner was recommending this place, however I think the hype it‚Äôs overrated, for our visit to say at least, the cocktail menu is nothing impressive or innovative, the salad and the mussel are both meh, the pasta was under seasoned, the wine could get reduced a bit more as you can still taste the alcohol, only thing better was the duck wings. Service was good but the food is not worth going back for.Hubby and I were celebrating our honeymoon in Victoria and decided to check out Little Jumbo. It was a really nice atmosphere.

The food was quite tasty.. the drinks were strong! Service was pretty good, although the bartender was quite busy so wasn‚Äôt able to give us much attention. When we were finished and wanted to pay for our bill, he was nowhere in sight so we flagged down another waitress to cash us out.

Overall I would recommend checking it out. Apparently the menu changes weekly so you likely won‚Äôt be able to try the same things we did. The scallop pasta was delicious, slightly small portion and a little bit pricy.Nice little hidden resto bar that was perfect for a way to end the evening. We came in here for dinner but were pleasantly surprised by the late night menu. We ordered fries, crab cakes, shishito peppers, and Tuna tartar and everything was generous portions and very good! Cocktails were excellent, though on the pricier end. Lovely atmosphere üíï"

Maybe not a sanctuary, but there was a mother deer and her fawn grazing in the grass. Truly amazing experience at dinner.
I had the beef short rib, it was slow roasted over 48 hours! Resulting in tender and delicious beef.  Tasted amazing with the sauces included.
This is a perfect date spot, and I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something special!What an incredible restaurant!
The beet appetizer has such a great texture. The dumplings had the most delicious peanut sauce. The lamb and pork were both cooked beautifully. The potatoes and vegetables on the side had perfect seasoning. The Demi glaze was perfect with a beautiful rosemary flavour. The mascarpone cheesecake with blueberry and lemon was truly delightful.

Thank you for such an incredible meal!A neighborhood high-end restaurant that starts serving dinner at 4pm.  Chef also runs front of house and greets customers herself.  Recommend calling in for a reservation as the restaurant is short staffed.  You can discuss your dietary restrictions with the chef and request to add extra protein or carbs to you main dishes.  Pasta and fish dish changes daily.  Lots of cocktail and wine selection.This place is great! They are on the 2nd floor, and they have the patio as well!

Lamb rack is very good, with nice display, very delicious on the lamb!

The filet mignon is very good as well, good cooked, and nice display too.

The dessert is very nice as well, hot with vanillia ice cream, tastes the best!

From the beginning before entered the restaurant, we saw the deer or coyote on the opposite grass, very cute!Lovely neighbourhood restaurant with extremely fresh, tasty, and comforting meals. You could tell they were made with love. We had the gnocchi to share as a starter, ribs, and then sampled all the desserts‚Äîthe sticky toffee pudding was to die for!

The owners are also incredibly nice, which made it a really fun dining experience.

Oh, and well-priced cocktails, to boot!"
ChIJG0qUo5p0j1QRJZTgAA9kdys,Pagliacci's,4.4,48.4244429,-123.3664177,3614,"We came for dinner on an early Monday evening and there was already a lineup. The host told us that it was the ‚Äúfastest moving lineup in Victoria‚Äù and, not too long after, we were seating inside.

The atmosphere was very lively and the decor had lots of interesting things to look at.

Overall, the food was delicious! The house-bread was so good that we just couldn‚Äôt stop eating it. We ordered an assortment of appetizers including the Crab Cakes, Meatballs and Mezze Platter; and for mains, we tried a couple seafood pastas and mixed seafood bowl.

The portions were substantial although the amount of seafood in of the pastas wasn‚Äôt as abundant compared to other dishes. Also, some shrimps could have been cleaned better.

We also tried several drinks and cocktails; and, they were nice. We sat close to the bar so, the bartender took good care of us personally.

The rest of the staff was very friendly and diligent as well.When they say they‚Äôll find you a spot and the lineup will be fast they mean it! It‚Äôs so busy and booming with life in this restaurant and makes for great atmosphere. The food was delicious, we got the Minnesota Fats to start, followed by The Prawn Broker and The Big Easy for our main. We also had sangrias on tap, and a glass of wine each. The service was great considering how busy it is, there‚Äôs always someone making sure every table has what they need and asked for in a timely manner. I highly recommend eating here if you‚Äôre in Victoria, all around great experience.We stop by this place for lunch and love it! All the staff was super friendly, helpful, and kind. We enjoy talking with them. Everything we ordered from the food and drink was savory! They have such a huge selection of lunch and drinks.
The restaurant itself is small, but they do offer outdoor sitting. Walk-in only. First, come serve. Thursday to Sunday they offer live jazz music. Check them out if you are in the area.The food (pasta) at this place was amazing!!!

I ordered The Shell Game dish and I got to say it's probably one of the best pasta dish I ate. The only complaint I have was that the size of the food is small so definitely go for size Large as it's just a few dollars more!

The happy hour appetizers were also good.

The service was also excellent although I can see our waiter is way too busy (it was crowded) so he forget us a couple times but he was pleasant nonetheless. The setting is sort of very crowded (tables too close) so that's the only real downside.

I'm definitely coming back here again if I'm at Victoria Island.This restaurant is what my food dreams are made of. Everything, and I mean everything, was the closest to perfect I have ever experienced. From the clever item names, to the perfectly procured *local* (silk road brand) tea, and the live band. We shared the duck wings (a little spicy, perhaps too spicy for some), and I had the enchantment under the sea salad. Unfortunately, they were all out of salmon, but their grilled chicken did not disappoint. Bring a hefty wallet (worth every penny), your appetite, and enjoy!"

The staff is very friendly the food is incredibly delicious. I can‚Äôt believe someone said that is ‚Äútasteless‚Äù but they probably don‚Äôt have taste buds. Anyways I totally recommend this place 100%!! Cant wait to eat here again.This has to be the freshest and delicious Mexican food in Victoria. The staff are so nice and happy, the vibe is like family.So yummy, very kind. I had the green chicken enchiladas and it was the perfect amount and super yummy! Highly recommend!Yeah, so friendly and very delicious. Enjoyed our Chilada‚Äòs and this amazing chocolate and custard cake. Loved it.I've been there twice and had green enchiladas and my girlfriend had the empanadas. The food is the most delicious Mexican I've had!

However, food wise we only liked the Korean cauliflower per the suggestion from the waitress. My green salad was missing tomatoes and had almost no pumpkin seeds and cranberries. Felt very cheap. My friend power bowl had no sauce, and so little quinoa. Again not impressed and we were disappointed. Sangria were good. I‚Äôm willing to come back but I might stick to burgers.A friend took me to McRae's for the first time and I was a little disappointed with the food I received. Granted, the restaurant was quaint. To start, my friend and I shared the hummus that was in the 'share plates' section and it was delicious. The naan bread/pita tasted super good with the hummus and the carrots was crispy and fresh. We weren't super hungry so we got a grilled cheese and the mac and cheese off of the happy hour menu. Can't go wrong with the grilled cheese, nice and crispy. The mac and cheese on the other hand, it was really disappointing. The cheese sauce they used made the whole thing super unappetizing, also the cold cheese and breadcrumbs on top just made it worse. Also it was lukewarm, it did not taste fresh at all. The service was alright, there was a lack of eye contact super mediocre.I was at the restaurant a few days ago and sat outside on there front patio. It's not an ideal spot to sit when it's cold out since they only have one working heater for the entire space. As for food, it was tasty. I had a breakfast sandwich and fries. The fries were crispy and delicious! The service was decent enough but it was hard to hear our server. She spoke really quietly and didn't look super happy to be there, but we got everything we asked for which is good. I'd probably go back but I'd be more careful about where I sit.-good nachos, not a huge serving
-blue moon wings were great, came with carrots and dip
-sat outside on the patio with the heaterFood was great 10/10
Atmosphere was cool but very loud 7/10
Service was ‚Äúneed to work on it‚Äù 4/10

Waitress was kinda rude, she was like pushing us to leave by coming to check while we‚Äôre talking and taking longer to eat our food, and then she asked us if we‚Äôre ready for the bill !
Once we are I guess we can call you and ask you ourselves to get us the bill !
No one is running away before paying your tips !"

The servers are also friendly and welcoming. It could be because there are many people that come here for brunch especially during the weekend and there's usually a line up that we feel that the servers are in a hurry for you to pay for your food so you can go and let others Seat. My sister hasn't even finished her coffee when the server came with the card machine and asked us if we are ready to pay. If you want a more relax place or a space where you can chat more with your friends or love ones over brunch,  maybe this is not the place for you. But if it is just brunch that you want to try, John's could provide that for you.John's Place in Victoria, BC is an absolute gem! The pancakes were definitely the highlight of our breakfast - perfectly cooked and huge in size. The food was absolutely delicious and left us wanting more. But what really stood out was the exceptional service by the staff - they were beyond nice and made our dining experience truly memorable. If you're looking for a 5-star breakfast spot in Victoria, John's Place is the place to go!It was my first time John‚Äôs and also Victoria too. All of my friend recommend this place for brunch. So i went there around 11:30 with my gf. There were several teams waiting. I put the name in the list and wait 20min(it was worth to doü§§). I saw the food which people ate while i was being served the table and it looks very delicious. I ordered classic benny and it was legit!! Also staffs are very friendly and very kind!! They made my day!!Had a pleasant breakfast here. The service is excellent; always quick to top up coffee and check-in unobtrusively. I always walked by as a kid growing up and haven't been here in over a decade but it was wonderful be able to come back and enjoy everything that makes this place historical. From the fresh delicious food, great staff, to the one of a kind decor, this is a local legend of a restaurant.This restaurant has really nice retro decor. Service is great but the food was mediocre. The waffles tastes like those DIY waffles at a hotel breakfast and the burgers were bland. The espresso milkshake was delicious though!"

The food was very good, but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest the kale Caesar salad, as it was too salty (this is coming from a person who enjoys salt). Modern and artsy. We‚Äôll be back :)Wow, wow, wow.

Incredible, locally sourced and seasonal ingredients crafted into well-balanced, playful and beautiful dishes. Comfortable, intimate atmosphere. Well-trained, knowledgeable, friendly staff. Perhaps the strongest cocktail program in the city with simply transcendent cocktails crafted by a bar staff who can build layer upon layer if flavour.Totally blown away by the prix fixe menu we had a couple weeks ago. From the cocktails to the dessert everything was simply incredible. Best part of the courses were they were all things I wouldn't have normally ordered for myself and I love each and every one of them.The seafood pasta is outstanding!! I forgot to take a photo of the chicken sandwich and was so delicious, very crispy outside and soft inside.

The atmosphere was so chill and I think the place is perfect for cozy dinner dining. The owner Segar and his partner both know the industry very well that's why their food was awesome.

It's my first time visiting The hallway. My boyfriend and I had a fantastic experienceüôèüèΩüëç The beautiful ceiling lighting gives me a rolls royce ceiling lights vibe and I LOVE IT.It was a really nice spot and the food was so good.

We love the dome, it's much quieter and private. Last time we had the kids with us and we were so at ease there as we knew we were not bothering anyone and our toddler wouldn't just runaway. We ate at peace. It is not just good food, it's a dining experience that all couples and young families should have.Let‚Äôs start with the positive. View is extraordinary, you get to see the inner harbour from a very good angle. Staff are friendly and helpful. Now the terrifying part is the food which is a hit and miss. Chicken wings were amazing. Burger, sandwich, and fish and chips were horrifying. It‚Äôs hard to screw up fish and chips on the island. So many other places do it so well. The batter was very thick AND soft. Thick batter we have seen, but soft thick uncooked batter is weird. As for the the burger and sandwiches, bacon was very hard, patty all you taste is salt, and the buns were quite burned. Fries, some were not folly cooked. Manager was quick to address our experience. People here are nice, but I don‚Äôt know if I would risk the chance for the food though.Overlooking the harbor, this restaurant offers a stunning view that captivates. Too bad the rest wasn't the same. While the service was fine but not great, the food falls short of inspiration or taste.  Nonetheless, the picturesque location may still appeal to those seeking a scenic dining experience with average culinary offerings.I took my mother and grandma here for dinner. It was wonderful to sit in one of the domes out side and have our own private space. The heater made it so cozy and we appreciated that there are blankets if we need. The food and drinks were amazing and the server was lovely. Our only complaint is after they served us coffee and a drink after dinner, the server  completely dissapeared. It would have been nice to have another round of drinks/ coffee but, we waited over 20 minutes AFTER finishing our drinks before giving up and going in to pay. At a nice establishment like this, I expect service right to the very end.This place was great. Nice big restaurant area. Staff were great!
Really good quality food and nice drink. We actually laughed at another review about this place because it must have been an off night. Everything was great, big wine list too."

I come across this place back in 2012 and just fell in love with there food and the atmosphere of the place.
Recently was here for a deluxe cheese burger and poutine and they did not disappoint. Great quality food , very friendly customer service and very clean atmosphere.
If I was a local I‚Äôd be here a few times a week.
Very much a jewel of a place in Victoria.
What ever there doing there doing it right to be there as long as they have.
My grandfather asked me back in 2012 to check this place out as he loved it when he was living there in 1969 - 1971 said it was his go to place.
I really can‚Äôt recommend this place enough.
Really enjoy the food .
They also offer an outdoor patio as well .
Hope to get back here again.
Thanks for the memories Beacon Drive In Restaurant ! üçî üòãMy friend and I decided to go here for lunch.
We went inside as the line was short.
It was super busy and very loud.
When I picked up our food, I noticed that I got French fries instead of the onion rings I ordered .
I asked for them to be replaced.
Then, to make things easier, I said I would eat the fries.
The gentleman helping me said he would bring me onion rings.
I was truly disappointed as they were stuck together and way over fried.
I had to go back to get sauce for chicken fingers and was told I had to pay. Even though 1 pk is included.
He ended up bringing the sauce over, not knowing we had none.
Then it was time to get into my burger.
It wasn't even warm.
I took it  back and asked for my money to be refunded.
The same gentleman brought me my $ to the table.
I have been to this place so often and have had excellent burgers.
Today was a disaster.
On top of that, the same gentleman had to ask an employee to get up from one of the tables that is for paying guests.
The two older ladies actually apologized for asking her to move.
Wth?
What is the matter with this generation ?
I have yet to call the manager and put in a complaint.

I get that fast food places get busy.
It was one issue after the other today.
I'm completely disappointed with my visit today.What a fantastic spot! Food comes up promptly and always so good! Ice cream of course is delicious too! Staff works very good together and makes the experience that much better. Very family friendly and good for any occasion.

We finally narrowed down our choices. My wife had the Fuego Benny and I went with the Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast with side of blueberry coulis.
The flavours and textures and presentation are spot on.
It was all just so good and we left happy and very full.
Special thanks to our server Michelle for excellent service.
Can't wait to come back!I decided to try the harvest breakfast and it did not disappoint! It was a tasty dish with a hint of spice that gave it an extra kick. I also loved the homemade salsa sauce - it was so good that I ended up buying a bottle to take home with me.

The service was also very friendly and fast. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and welcoming, and it was right next to the sea which.

For dessert, I decided to try the churros pancakes which were simply delicious. However, I must say that they were a bit too sweet for my taste.

Additionally, there were plenty of parking spots available right in front of the restaurant which made it very convenient. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast with a great view and friendly service.Very few Mexican restaurants have the right touch and atmosphere. This is an incredible gem right on Victoria harbour. Food is amazing and the decor is fantastic with priceless huge posters of the Mexican revolution and old town feel.  I always come when I visit Victoria. Try the Divorciados eggs and corn bread. They are superb!You‚Äôd never expect to find authentic Mexican flavors in Victoria yet we ventured and were not disappointed.

Service was great and the food was even better. They also have a great vegan option section with several dishes.
Definitely recommended!!Amazing food. I got the chiliqueles which pulled pork. Sooo good. Had to try the cornbread which was fantastic. Great overall dining experience. I'm coming back for the chimichanga"

Spring rolls were great. The red curry & the cashew chicken weren‚Äôt bad. The chicken pad Thai was easily the worst I‚Äôve ever had - No flavour and the saddest amount of chicken. I would have returned it if I lived closer.A great place to eat, with good service, and tasty food.
My only complaint is that they leave the tails on the shrimp when they serve them, but I‚Äôm sure you could ask for the tails off.The lunch combo is so good. It is a good deal,  tofu green curry combo and Thai iced tea for around $18, excellent value and super delicious food.I have never been to a Thai restaurant that I would recommend other people to go and try out their food.

The second delicious piece was grilled pork belly. The flavour was fabulous. I ordered the Kalettes veggie main course and again the flavours didn‚Äôt disappoint. Rich and unusual while being amazing. My server strongly recommended the chocolate dessert which I cannot say enough about. It was sweet, salty, creamy and decadent without being overpowering. Overall the meal was 5 star. The vibe of the place is calm and smooth while being friendly and relaxed. I will definitely be back.Overall great experience! Started with a condensed milk shaft that I absolutely loved and every dish that followed was great. I ordered the pork and the texture was perfect, very soft and dissolved in your mouth. The broccoli and the cheesecake were also super tasty. I ordered three dishes to share, one cheesecake, and one cookie and it was more than enough for two people so I recommend sharing. Service was great, we sat at the bar and they were very attentive and helpful when explaining portion size etc. I would definitely recommend this place!Good food, nice staff, and cute atmosphere!

Probably more ideal for groups between 2-5, though I'm sure larger groups can be accommodated for if you come early enough.

No on site parking, but it was easy to find a spot around the block.

However, I do agree with another reviewer about prices. I didn't mind it because I enjoyed the food in the end, but, for what you get, the price does catch you a little off guard. Would still recommend going here at least once, though!Rice and Pickles bowl, with fried chicken.

Peanuts did not smell like they were freshly toasted, but instead had a musty aroma. Rice was clumpy and not well washed/cooked/fluffed. Pickles were okay, chicken had great texture in the batter but seemed pinkish and the seasoning had not penetrated throughout the meat. Food was served warm but not hot. Mediocre at best.

Service was good, atmosphere close to perfect.
Overall a disappointing experience due to the food.This has got to be the best fried chicken sandwich I‚Äôve ever had! It was juicy and crispy and the sauces were all finger licking good! The menu changes often too so I can‚Äôt wait to come back when it does!"

Located only steps away from the Best Western Plus Inner Harbour hotel, the Victoria Harbour House Restaurant boasts a well rounded menu for varying palates.

The staff were friendly and helpful and the service was one of a kind... the personal touch and humor provided a welcoming atmosphere...Bob was fantastic!

The food was well prepared and the presentation was simple but perfect for this particular place.

We had the Escargot Bourguignon and French Onion soup to start... both very delicious !

We enjoyed the 6oz New York Steak with Lobster... the steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection!

We also had the Shrimp scampi which was served with a very delicate but flavorful white wine sauce... yummy!

Can't forget to mention the fantastic wine and dessert selection! The Cr√®me Brul√©e was one of the best I've had, the Lemon Cheesecake with blueberry sauce was light and flavorful, and the Chocolate Mousse was dreamy!

Overall 4.5 üåü for quality, taste, service, location, experience, and atmosphere!

The hours are 4pm to 8pm... we went as a walk in and were lucky to get a seat; I would recommend a reservation.Good friendly service and attentive. They had a special for steak and lobster with a salad. The lobster was good but the steak was lower quality for sure. The bread was good though. You will need a vaccine card to dine in. They are only opened during dinner hours.Celebrated my husband's birthday in this quaint and home style atmosphere. Waitress was attentive. Food was very good. Been in business for 40+ years. Would eat here againService was good. But non-alcoholic cocktails contain alcohol. 5 months ago, I had gastric cancer surgery. so absolutely alcohol is dangerous to me. also, my friend's food has a kitchen iron brush. My birthday dinner has become a risky meal.4/5 and 4/6/23:  It‚Äôs not often good cuisine meets stellar service and wonderful atmosphere!  As a solo diner, I didn‚Äôt feel slighted and was seated at a window table.  I had the spaghetti bolognese on day 1 and returned to have steak & prawns with the house salad on day 2.  I was a happy grandma.  Thanks, Julie!"
ChIJeVwsJYB0j1QRn7FdyRpPUp8,Wendy's,3.3,48.4358351,-123.3631557,1240,"Edit: The service here is ABYSMAL. Dude only filled my chili cup half way, after I had to remind them about it because they didn't put it in my bag. Had to ask for hot sauce and crackers too. I understand that fast food is the bottom of the barrel for jobs, but it's incredible how incompetent some people can be.

If there is more than one person in line, don't expect to get your food for at least 10-15 minutes. Almost as slow as the Pandora Mcdons, which is saying something. Food is good, but holy smokes the staff are slllllllloooooooooooooooooow.We came in just after 10am today to try their breakfast croissant after receiving coupons in the mail. I had the silly idea yo give the place yet another chance after multiple disappointing experiences.

A number of other reviewers have commented on dirty/sticky tables. I can verify that this should be expected - seeing dirty tables at opening.

I wasn't acknowledged by the person behind the counter, even after saying hello...  Eventually, a manager and a counter staff came to the till and logged in (no greeting or explanation of what was happening).

The customer experience was disappointing I felt like my morning visit was an inconvenience. Unimpressed with the quality and tasty of the food.

It's nice to see rapport between staff but it's important to be mindful that it's a job and not a social space.

There was a training session in progress near my table and good information was being provided to incoming staff.. hence the 2 stars instead of 1.

The quality of coffee cups was the impressive aspect of my visit. I wish these guys the best... Wendy's is my fast food outlet of choice but I do not recommend visiting this location.The staff is so friendly and awesome! Every time I go, I see them working so hard behind the counter and they give me very delicious lunches. My only issue is some days (two Fridays I've tried so far) the dining room is closed due to lack of staff and since I don't drive a car here, I can't order, but that's no fault of the employees. Keep up the good work Wendy's!I was crew on opening day for this location back in 2002. (I think that was the year) anyway.. the process has changed so much that the food prep is not the same. The quality coming from this location has been consistently poor. When I asked for a fresh crispy chicken, you know.. the nice crispy ones? Yeah, I got the chicken that expired in the draw of shame. It was nasty.

The meat used to be hand laid and pressed (4 corner press) and now they use the clamp method of cooking in masses and it doesn't have the same level of care. Nor did it speed up the process.

I used to love Wendy's when quality was actually their recipe....The food quality is a bit better at Wendy's compared to other fast food offerings, and it is nice they have more healthy options on the menu - baked potatoes, salads and chili. The most frustrating thing about this location is the order completeness when going through the drive through. Regularly items are missing or incomplete. This gets worse if you have any modifications to items but also regularly will miss dressing for salad, utensils, etc."
ChIJ12sgE5B0j1QRZkOrokQGuN0,The Sticky Wicket Bar & Restaurant,4.1,48.4230776,-123.3654012,2429,"Steak was well cooked with delicious herb butter on top. Brussel sprouts were way undercooked, mashed potatoes were really salty. Mac and cheese is incredible, though - you can add chicken, broccoli, etc for an extra charge. Our server was nice, but only visited the tables on each side of us (not ours) in the last 20 minutes, so it took a long time to get our check. We never got a refill on water either, but maybe they figured the bottle of wine was adequate for us üòâ Be aware that there's a game room with pool etc, sports games on TV, so it can get a little loud if you're seated near it. Main dining room is relatively quiet otherwise, or it was when we went. Basically the food is good, service is alright, and they have a rooftop patio that looks great. The food was good enough that I'd give it another chance when I'm in town. It wasn't particularly busy, but maybe our server had more tables in another room that kept her busier than we were aware of?Old world charm meats big screen TV's.
Nice selection of both import and local brewery beer. I went with the wicket lager, it's brewed by Vancouver island brewery.
Menu is not overwhelming and it's easy to find something you want to try. Whether it be bangers and Mash, a burger or even mac and cheese.
The food is seasoned well and decent portions.
Staff were all welcoming and friendly.  We did find that one gentleman who brought the food to the table wore entirely too much cologne. It was to the point I would sneeze every time he walked past us.
Perhaps businesses need to bring back the no scent atmosphere for their customers convenience.
We will return.
Import beer is priceyCool atmosphere. We were visiting Victoria and stopped in for some drinks and food. First place that asked us for two IDs, which is apparently a practice in BC..found that interesting and had to go back to our hotel to grab it. When we got in and saw how big the place was, it made a bit more sense to us!

I wish I could remember our servers name, he was fairly new to Victoria - recently moved from Calgary. He was great - super friendly and attentive.

The food was pretty good as well. Had the chicken quesadillas, Caesar salad and hubby got the jambalaya. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!Wish there were more vegetarian/vegan options, but for a traditional pub it was great! I had the Baha bowl with tofu and it was great. My friend had the bangers and mash and said it was ok.Our yearly tradition to visit while dine around is on. Have had some truly incredible experiences in past years.

This year was disappointing. Specifically:
1. Appy: spouse got the Brussels which was a good sized portion but they must have added two much lemon or something making it sour. The soup I got in comparison was tiny, but tasty.

2. Main course: spouse got steak and lobster. Although steak was medium rare it was tough and difficult to cut.

3. Service: We ran out of water in the small glasses of water they provide during our appy and was never offered a refill. The appy came relatively quickly but the gap between finishing appy before main and main to dessert was significant.

Will likely return again to give them another chance next year, but do recommend giving them a miss for the 2023 dine around."
ChIJh8S3aVJxj1QR1Fc9otI_Y1g,Thai Lemongrass Restaurant,4.2,48.461517,-123.2973538,499,"We came on a Thursday at around 4:00 pm. I had read multiple reviews where they said the service was slow etc. So I had prepared myself in advance for this and to my surprise it was not slow at all. But that's probably because the restaurant was empty at 4 and there was no one here but us. The food came out really fast and the servers were really attentive. They gave out new plates for appetizers, mains and desserts. They weren't over bearing but when asking for the bill and to order it might be a bit difficult depending on where you are sitting in the restaurant but that's just my take. On to the food!

Por pia -$10 - 4 spring rolls with a sweet and sour sauce. Very crispy. Lots of cabbage inside. Not overly salty

Prawn Pad Thai - $15.50 - big portion. I liked the proportion of fresh bean sprouts and peanuts to noodles. There were around 7-8 big shrimps which was very generous for the price. The noodles were nicely cooked. A lot of places that have pad Thai always overcook their noodles and they break easily but here they are still intact long noodles. They are bouncy and have a good chew to then. Not overly sweet or salty. Nicely seasoned and not too oily.

Vegetable green curry - $14.95 - lots of veggies - green peppers, bamboo shoots, carrots etc. The curry itself was really flavourful. Hint of lemongrass. Went so well with just plain rice. I could eat lots of rice with this dish (maybe 3 bowls haha)

Drunken chicken noodles - $14.50 - big portion. Very strong basil flavour overall which I really liked. The noodles were again nicely cooked. Good amount of chicken. Would definitely order it again.

Deep fried banana with ice cream - $5.50 - not too sweet. The batter was nice and thin and crispy. Good way to end the night.

Overall I would recommend this place for Thai food. The interior feels very homey and the service is pretty good. The portions are good enough to feed a couple people and the flavours are pretty good. The prices are also reasonable for the amount of food you get.

TIP: order their drunken noodlesThese guys are the real deal! I sat down and felt cared for. The whole meal the front of house staff were literally running back and forth to get everyone taken care of on a busy Friday night. Major props to those guys. There‚Äôs absolutely no doubt that they‚Äôre working hard. I even saw one of the servers take the time to work through a customer speaking in a language he didn‚Äôt understand. He was patient, kind and took the time to take great care of the customer despite the fact that it took him away from his duties to other customers. I have absolutely no problem waiting a few extra minutes for service like this.

The food was also fantastic. I ordered a pineapple fried rice and it was something completely new to me. The portion sizes were very generous and I left feeling the way one should feel walking out of a restaurant. Satisfied but wanting to taste more! Nowadays companies are doing everything they can to limit portion sizes and increase prices, Lemongrass did not meet this stereotype, they gave me a generous portion that left me satisfied with the price I paid. The dish also tasted absolutely amazing. 10/10 cannot wait to come back and try another dish. Bravo!Finally found the best Thai Food in Victoria. Made a reservation for 4:15 to avoid the dinner rush. Service was top notch and the the food did not disappoint. From the first sip of my Tom Ka Gai soup I knew I had finally found the quality authentic Thai I have been looking for. I‚Äôll be back with more friends next time.I ordered takeout here for the first time, took an hour which was fine, I showed up on time, there was only one line for dining in or picking up. After a few minutes, I told the hostess I was here for pickup and she said to go back in line. After another 5 minutes or so, she asked my name and got our food, which was very good.
I don't think I will ever go here or get takeout again.Amazing food! Even better service! I ordered the red curry lunch combo, extra hot. It was perfect in every way, with enough food to take for a snack later. I loved it! They gave great beer as well. The staff was super attentive, but never overwhelming. The washroom was clean. The atmosphere is inviting and the location could not be better, within walking distance of the beach. I love this place and will be back!"

The potatoes are the perfect crispy fluffy ratio. The duck just fell off the bone & the sauce that same with it paired perfectly well. Would definitely go back & recommended. Only downside is that it's small so not lots of seating, but still worth a visit. The staff were also helpful & friendly :)It was perfect place with baby. My friend took her 10 weeks girl. The staffs was so nice and kind. We ordered 3 kinds of dishes. All good. Yummy with good coffee! It was first time visiting. Park also convinced.Amazing! We've visited the Ruby on Johnson, and had an incredible breakfast before, so we figured we'd try this location too.

Incredible (seriously) service, with 100-watt smiles. Not sure what our server's name was, but she absolutely earned her Wonder Woman tattoo (thank you again for a wonderful experience)!

The food was as delicious (and filling) as our previous experience. The mountains of waffles had our kids on cloud nine, while the breakfast tacos were a slam dunk for the grown ups. I'm not sure what they were called, but the ones with bacon are absolutely phenomenal - especially when drizzled with their homemade garlic hot sauce.

Yeah, we'll be back, all right. :)What an awesome little gem hidden in plain sight, lol! Didn't have to wait too long for a table. Service was top notch, friendly, and prompt.

The restaurant is huge so I understood more as we were seated. The design of the restaurant was good but fairly basic and comfortable. It was very busy but I felt like they did a great job getting food and drinks to us. The value of the food was pretty good and they have a great food and beverage selection. The kids meals were generous and tasty. I had the seafood fettuccine Alfredo and I found it quite watery and bland. My sister has the manicotti and she thought it was good.

I don‚Äôt take a picture of my food but, because I was so starving that evening so, I forgot to take some pictures. Everything was absolutely delicious and amazing supper. Their warm bread with whipped garlic butter were top notch! Keep asking them to refill and they bring it up on the table. Always make reservation before otherwise you will be waiting for a long time to get your table. And because they are busy, just be patience and be kind to the waitress. They serve you really well.Food was really good. Service was attentive, knowledgeable, welcoming.

Prices are great and everything-included makes it easy to budget for 4-or-more.

Personnel were great from host to server; seem like they worked well as a team during a busy, busy visit.

On a sunny mid-afternoon I walked in as a single guest. I got taken ahead of walk-in groups of 3+ and large group reservations.

I got visit. Not 'fine dining' but fine enough for me!

Upon reading a number of reviews, we ordered a seafood pasta and a calamari since we were feeling still half-full from lunch. They gladly accommodated our request for substituting mussels for more of other kinds of seafood. We were amazed at how everything tasted so fresh, from the focaccia and olives to the pasta! Especially the pasta was simply the best seafood pasta I have ever had (remember we were not too hungry to begin with..)! We loved it was tomato-based rather than oil-based, and the prawns and scallops were cooked to perfection. An added bonus was that our server, Marissa, was incredibly friendly and made us feel comfortable the entire time.A local legend in Victoria with a rich history. Haven‚Äôt been here in 20 years but it‚Äôs every bit as good. Generous portions and fair prices. The fresh made focaccia bread and olive tapenade are a wonderful start to the meal.

At least the fries were decent!

I‚Äôll update this rating if I go back and another item is more appetizing, it might be just the gluten free bun and the cheap pre-sliced cheese. Maybe the gluten bun makes it better, I know it‚Äôs hard for restaurants to cater to celiac customers and appreciate their effort."

Overall, I highly recommend The Mint to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in downtown Victoria. With friendly and attentive guest skills and mouth-watering dishes like the tofu, it's a must-visit destination for foodies and those seeking a memorable night out. üçΩÔ∏èüëåKnew this place since its opening way back when as it took over the spot of one of my former favorite teenage stomping grounds (Victoria Underground Onramp Cybercaf√©) but never really had the chance to go in. I made an exception since I saw the sign for their appy hour which is 17:00-19:00 which is refreshingly late considering how I rush out after work to downtown and usually miss it with the bus commute.

The double mojito & the chicken poutine are okay, but the momos are amazing. I was recommended chicken which I had but the pork ones taste the best. I like the ambiance and I do see some areas where I do remembered the old days.

Perhaps someone should start up old meets from decades past in here. I wouldn't mind having some nostalgia resurfacing in this joint. The bartender's real sweet so don't be shy and go for the bar seating.Imagine this: it's a Friday night at 11pm - and as much as Victoria is a cute town, there really isn't that many places to get any food late night that isn't fast food or pizza.

I'd say a 4.8 if we could be more precise and definately would recommend and would come back again.

The Guacamole and chips are yummy too, the chips are nice and crunchy with the right amount of seasoning. Definitely recommend. It's our favorite place for tacos any day of the week üòãIn and out quick for our first try at La Taqueria.  The space is pretty cool with the exposed beams and venting overhead, the bar and kitchen being in the middle of the restaurant is also nice.  Staff were super friendly and pleasant especially our server.  My daughter and I had a taco each, she had the al pastor and I the carnitas, both on corn tortillas.
I love that they used both a yellow and a blue corn tortillas and were warmed nice and soft but cooked.
The carnitas were quite nice.  Nice balance of flavours although as a personal preference I wanted a little more crackling/fat to lean meat ratio.  All three hot sauces(not pictured)  were their own flavour profiles and heat levels so that was A+.
The pastor for my daughter, she said was ‚Äúok‚Äù, she rates it a 3.5 stars as she was looking for that nicely shaven/char from the meat that‚Äôs cooked nicely on the spit and she feels she didn‚Äôt get that.  (She‚Äôs had a lot of Al Pastor at different taco stands in Mexico last year, so I feel it‚Äôs a fair opinion). The pineapple salsa was a bit much for her in terms of ratio with the meat so she took some off which I ate and I quite liked them actually.
Cannot wait to come back to try everything.Aye yaye yaye! Lunch was everything we could ask for. Fast service and really yummy meals. We had the fried chicken burrito, fish baja tacos, beef burrito and of course the very tasty and chilled Miss Hibiscus Margarita. Definitely coming back to try more tacos and special drinks!The tacos were super delicious!  I‚Äôm super happy I tried this place.  The tacos were a bit pricey but I will come back. And I would love to see what they have for their happy hour.  Highly recommend!"

The place has a fairly cozy atmosphere and fair portion sizes, hands down the papaya salad was the best thing we had. It's been ages since we've had a good papaya salad with a proper spice to it. Martini was a touch bit on the strong side and don't bother with the coffee if you're looking for a caffeine slap. Overall will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!Dined in last night and ordered the crispy squid, red curry, and spicy lemongrass fried rice. The food was excellent and some of the best Thai food I‚Äôve ever had in Victoria . The cocktails were also amazing. Annabell was our server and provided us with excellent customer service. I will definitely be coming back!Best Thai food in Victoria! The food is exceptional and the service is flawless. Our server, Ella, was so friendly and offered us some great recommendations. Delicious food, relaxed ambience and super friendly staff keep us coming back regularly. I would highly recommend this restaurant!Not really traditional Thai food, way too sweet in every dishBaan Thai service is amazing! The food is brilliant!

In Oak Bay, there's a place to dine,
Where cuisine is spectacular and so divine.

Baan Thai, you'll come to know,
As a flavoured journey that'll make you glow.

From savory curries to spicy soups,
Each dish is crafted with exotic roots.

With flavors that dance upon your tongue,
And aromas that leave you forever sprung.

As a flavoured journey that'll make you glow."

Slight wait (approximately 5-7 minutes) due to high volume but reasonable considering the full staff were keeping as fast as they could. Most customers who were here with me seem quite satisfied with their orders.

Some of the folks giving poor reviews on Maps seem to lack some common sense and are definitely trolls attributing to the overall great resignation impacting the food service industry. I can understand that service was not optimal at one point but if you check them out lately, they have significantly improved.Very tasty burger meals- nice date food before we headed to a movie üçø
We had the Uncle Burger and the Mama burger meal. The burger itself was very fresh and juicy to taste!They left me one Buddy Burger short on my order. I went back the following week and asked for an extra one. They did this without issue. Mistakes happen. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to fight them to make it right. Great service.I always have to wait 10 mins for the Beyond burger whenever I come here and other restaurants. Thankful for the only vegan choice, but it is frustrating. Anyways thanks for the BYND burger option.I don't normally go to fastfood but I really love the yam fries in this particular location today. They always make them fresh.

I had the lamb chops medium rare and they were the best tasting lamb chops I've EVER had!!! The cook and the seasoning were absolute perfection. We shared the flaming mozzarella for an app that was truly delicious. I would highly recommend eating here. You won't be disappointed....I promise!It‚Äôs so beautiful there, really friendly and disciplined staff. The chicken souvlaki was great. Lamb shank was a over priced. Three star because the potatoes were super salty, a pinch of salt is understandable but this much of salt was a surprise for such a well rated restaurant. I had a good experience because it represents Greece but probably not the best choice of food for a Greek restaurant. They can do better on the dishes for such a great place, but the tase was not extraordinary.

The menu was printed on regular piece of paper by a default font Microsoft word, absolute minimum effort, really?! It needs a better one.Excellent food. Just as good if not better in some cases than what I had in Greece. Service was very good too. Attentive. However it was a bit puzzling that they changed our waiter after we ordered without informing us...Quaint decor, and lots of seating.  The food was better than expected, and the Greek ribs and ekmek were excellent, fresh and tasty (ekmek is really hard to get right).  The service was friendly, welcoming and efficient (no wait without a reservation tonight at 6-ish).  Our server John was pleasant, attentive, light-hearted, and helpful.  All in all, surprisingly good Greek food experience.
$$$My friends took me there to celebrate my 41 b-day. üòÄ The ambiance is so welcoming and the server, Dimitri (hopefully I'm not wrong), so friendly, chatty, welcoming and professional. My friends and i had chicken soup, saganaki flamb√©e, and ""Appetizer for 2"" platter. Although it says for two people it was big enough to feed the three of us. Tiramis√π was my choice as ""b-day cake"", so refreshing and tasty.  Well, everything was delicious, I really enjoyed every single bite. Love this place and can't wait to return! üôè"

Staff is super friendly and the food is amazing. The burgers don‚Äôt come out looking picture perfect but they taste amazing!  And the veggie chips are a great alternative to fries!  Plus pinball machines to entertain you while they are making your order!  Definitely a must stop if you are in Victoria!One of the best veggie burgers I've had in a long while. Vegan mayo was silky and luscious! Pickles remind me of the ones made by my great aunt when I was a kid. Root veggie chips could be a meal on their own! Fun vibe, beautiful mural and atmosphere, caring staff, super clean, welcoming and inclusive space, and... PINBALL MACHINES! I wish I loved closer!The burgers and fries are great. They are cooked fresh when ordered and the ingredients are all locally sourced/ made.

This started as a food truck business which still goes strong in the summer. They also have a storefront with a few tables and some pinball games. It is very pared down. You go for the food and the friendly service not the ambiance.I ordered the deluxe chicken burger it was incredible it was huge! And I would recommend it was delicious I would come againHad high expectations but they fell off the table. Meat had no juice left over after the grill - perhaps they use a low fat beef (I dunno).

ChIJSfbyTJB0j1QRWTqiWMNmH4Q,Vista 18 Restaurant + Lounge,4.1,48.4221151,-123.3646122,552,"Took my best friend here for a birthday breakfast, as his first time at Vista 18. In my reservation I had requested a table overlooking the Inner Harbour if possible, for the special occasion. Upon arrival we were taken to the other side of the restaurant and seated with a less than desirable view of some buildings below. It was slightly busy, but noticed some empty tables as we walked in, so I inquired about a better table as per my online request. Though not a ‚Äòwindow‚Äô seat, our server was able to seat us at an empty elevated booth near the Harbour side of the restaurant, across the aisle from the windows, giving us a view of the ocean! My granola parfait was oddly mostly pineapple chunks, which I left as I dislike them; however, my breakfast potatoes were very good, and my friend enjoyed his benny. Our banana smoothies were also very delicious! Overall, it was a nice breakfast, reasonably priced, and our server was very nice! Would pass on the parfait for next time.

*Note: the empty tables pictured were mostly all occupied when we arrived*Overall upset about the service. Firstly, despite requesting window seats since booking close to 2 weeks in advance, they could only give us a booth across a walking aisle because the host said they were booked upon arrival. Throughout the meal until the end, I walked around the restaurant for the different views and for the bathroom and no one ever sat at those questionable ""booked"" tables. The view wasn't spectacular either way. The food was not bad as the flavor was on point and portions were as described. However, my $40 steak had over 25% worth of inedible membrane in it and I voiced my disappointment to the server. He was very polite but couldn't offer any good explanation. He mentioned he could get a discount on the bill but never got back to us until I question the bill at the end. Wish they could just offer a small percentage discount or even a small complimentary dessert. That could easily win a five-star. Small offerings to satisfy an upset customer goes a long way. I have been to many similar-level restaurants that could do much better. Quite a bit of improvement in management is needed, including seat allocation.A convenient downtown Victoria location, with a fantastic 270 degree wrap around view of the inner harbour. The food was excellent and the service staff were professional and very friendly. Made for a memorable dinner with friends.We had a wonderful dining experience here with great food and service and a fantastic view of the city. We had the fresh Oysters and Humboldt Squid as appetizers. Then the Sesame Tuna and Pork Tenderloin for our main course. Cheesecake and Three Truffles for dessert.We went in for me and my friends 18th birthday. Amelia was fun, helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu. She did a great job creating a laid back lovely experience. Food was fantastic, views absolutely worth it. Will be back the next time we are in the province!"

The service was very good and the guy taking our order was very nice, but the food was disappointing. The noodles were dry and the chicken chop suey soup was not flavorful. The sweet and sour pork was the only thing that saved the meal. Unfortunately will not be coming back.Great family restaurant and Victoria's best kept secret and hidden jem. Been going there since 2016 when I visit Victoria. Staff are friendly and serve huge portions. Delivery driver the other night when I had arrived in Victoria and checked in to the hotel was friendly and professional just like at the restaurant.Ordered vegetable chowmein and was slightly disappointed. I'll start with the good which was portion size. I got a lot of food for the money and feel it was worth it from a value perspective.

For the bad, the chowmein was drowned in a soupy sauce that made it soggy and wet which I was not a fan of. Secondly, while I appreciated the amount of vegetables there were way to many. It was like 60% vegetables and 40% noodles. I prefer a higher noodle ratio because that is what I enjoy eating. In the photo I removed the vegetables so you can see just how many noodles are actually left.

Flavor wise, it was ok... nothing to write home about. Nothing special and I kept having to get past the ""soupyness"". If I was in Victoria again I'd probably try elsewhere.I'd been looking for a Chinese food place to order from since I moved out to Vic for School, and Young's has hit home every time! The food really is good, and the owner is always so kind and passionate over the phone. I agree with some of the other reviews that I wish there was a menu update, as I'd love to be able to order dumplings haha, but its not a big deal. (Also I actually enjoy the spring rolls, they're crunchy and filled with cabbage)

I hope to go in to eat once the pandemic is over, but for now I'll settle for ordering Chinese food when I don't feel like doing my meal prep. It really is a treat to order from here.The service was very good, this was our first visit and we enjoyed the experience. I was disappointed that we could not get wine with our meal, but that is a minor issue. The war wonton was awesome."

The music is subtle (but good),the staff are lovely, and the food is excellent. Plus the menu is mostly sourced from ingredients local to the island.

One Cool thing about The Drake Eatery:

If chess is your thing, then I'd recommend you hit this spot with your favorite set and play buddy. It's not like tournaments happen here or anything like that. I just saw a pair playing when I was there and it just seemed like they were having a really good time.My first impression was the bar is well put together and atmosphere was awesome for downtown Victoria. I enjoy the somewhat open kitchen concept. You have to come up to the bar to order your food. The food is a hit/miss, the potatoes was a 3/10 very dilly. The Beef Tongue Reuben was a 7.7/10. First time trying beef tongue so it was good. The craft beer I ordered was okay. After you order your food, they don‚Äôt really check up on you and ask if you need anything else.I sat in the beer garden area. The beer garden has a smaller food and drink menu than the eatery which is located upstairs. Not sure why? They had a gluten free beer option on the upstairs menu but no option for the beer garden. Service was only bar service and it was slow.
The food itself was really good. Ordered the fish tacos and roast beef sandwich. Lots of seating in a nice open space.The Flensburger dunkle dark lager was very good. The cider was too hoppy for me I prefer a slightly sweeter cider. It tasted like grapefruit juice.
You serve yourself at the bar then take it outside.Great selection of beers; interesting menu and some wonderful selections. The grilled cheese with kimchi is a favourite. The nitro porter was one of the most enjoyable beers I‚Äôve had on tap. ‚Ä¶ came back again for my birthday; same positives and staff was awesome in accommodating a cake brought for me.

Never disappointed and we were happy to bring two couples with us this time. The ""first-timers"" were as impressed with their selections as well.  There is an accessible washroom (single room) which I believe is part of the hotel.  Unfortunately, there are a few things that need to be improved to make it friendlier.  The hook mounted on the door is too high for someone in a wheelchair as is the towel dispenser which requires hand motion to activate it.  These things could be easily fixed by adding a lower coat hook and lowering the towel dispenser.  The room is a good size and the there is an assist bar mounted beside the toilet.LOVE going to the Bar 500 for jazz nights. Its a cozy atmosphere and not too crowded. The menu is small and the food is delicious. Our only request/recommendation is to add a few monthly dining features to change things up a bit. We would come more often then. All in All, a GREAT venue.We visited in the evening for the Dine around town menu.  The mushroom chowder was amazing and creamy.  We had the sablefish entree which consisted of outstanding different flavours.  I hope they consider adding the sablefish dinner to their permanent menu.I got super sick after eating there last weekend. Would appreciate to be contacted by management for a refund. The minimum, after I spending 6 miserable days and counting battling fever and aches. Please tell your male clerk who was working the weekend brunch shift to not scratch his face while he puts away the ""clean"" cluttery. That is not food safe!

Unique menu with amazingly perfect flavor profiles. Great for a special date night or just a a casual dinner out. The staff are very friendly and very knowledgeable with food and wine pairings. 100% recommend - it is definitely my go to spot to impress friends and family!OVERALL:  Nice place with a great atmosphere. Not a great price / value ratio - Good Menu but  needs to improve the dishes. Realistically this place is somewhere between very good 3 stars and bad 4 stars.
DETAILED REVIEW:  Drinks were good and the service solid (Local Draft beers and an OK wine selection). The food was a disappointment unfortunately - we had high hopes. We had the croquettes (these are OK, these tasted too much  bbq sauce), cabbage rolls (good dish, but not cooked properly, the cabbage was still a little uncooked, and not soft), calamari starter (interesting BBQ flavour, ok but not convincing ) -  the paella (large hopes and biggest disappointment. Dish was super salty, the mix of seafood didn‚Äôt seem right - it came with broiled fish and grilled calamari steak on top - in a nutshell just weird and not well balanced) + we finished with a grilled foie gras (not great, somehow not a fresh and good flavour + too pricey).Spanish tapas influenced menu. We enjoyed the olives served with charred grilled bread to start. The paella was very nice, especially the Humboldt squid which was so tender and the salt cod which was fried crispy. Prices are on the higher side, but dishes seem to use quality ingredients."

ChIJ7bELJO10j1QRfDlmY2GMJVM,Big Wheel Burger COOK ST,4.4,48.415073,-123.3558604,1479,"It‚Äôs okay.
They are usually busy so that must be good for them, but for me about a 20 minute wait. The quality was 6/10 in my opinion, but the biggest problem are their prices. Paying over $20 for a burger without fries is too high for me. I respect the fact that they are saving the world one wooden fork at a time, but the wait, the quality, and the price of food isn‚Äôt worth it in my opinion.
Would I go back? Probobly not.The first time I had their double cheeseburger via delivery app, I already became a fan. Here‚Äôs me trying their crispy chicken burger at Cook St.  branch. They have a cool crew as well!Excellent quality fast food. They give back to the community too. The kids meal rocks ! We split a milkshake and they were kind enough to give us a second up & divide some up so my daughter couldn‚Äôt hog the whole thing üòÇAverage tasting burger, fries, and shake and WAY too expensive.  $25 for one person. That‚Äôs a hundred bucks for a family of four!  Ludicrous.  I won‚Äôt be eating there again.  Almost forgot to mention they ran out of ketchup. When I asked the staff they said ‚Äúyes, we are out‚Äù but then one of the staff offered me one of the prepared mini take out ketchup cups - which was just great‚Ä¶but it was almost like an afterthought.  You need to do better.This is a fast food restaurant. That being said, it is in a part of downtown Victoria which is charming and beautiful. Parking is fairly easy to find nearby. There are plenty of shops and interesting spots to check out which you are here.

The menu is a digital board and has an amusing set of cartoonish images it parcels through to keep you entertained while you wait for your food. Your carbonated beverages are in cans and above average taste. The ginger ale is good and is made with real ginger.

The young, redheaded man who worked the counter was very helpful in making sure our food was safe and helping us figure out what to order as first-time customers.

We visited here as they have gluten free buns and poutine. I was very happy to hear they have vegan aioli as well, as I'm allergic to eggs, in addition to gluten and wheat. We ordered two gluten free burgers (one black bean and yam) with bun and a gluten free poutine to share.

We were happy with the quality and amount of cheese on the poutine. The few fries we had, which were dry, were delicious. The gravy is bland and thin. It tastes like someone thickened bargain brand chicken stock and called it gravy. Because it was so thin, it sunk to the bottom of the fries, making all the fried potatoes on the bottoms gross mush. We both agreed we would not order this again, but we would order a plain fry.

That said, the gluten free buns were so like gluten buns in appearance, taste and texture, I went to ask if our order was really gluten free. I will be sick for months if I ingest gluten, so I needed to be sure. He said they have a local bakery make them just for this chain. All I have to say is the other eateries in the area need their number, because they were all the lumpy, dense, powdering gunk I sadly receive most of the time. The kitchen cut each the burger burger and the black bean burger in half, as we both wanted to try them. We swapped half of each and agreed the black bean and yam is in the top two for best black bean burgers we've ever had. The beans were not sandy mush, as so many are. They had texture and some light crunch on the outside edges. I happily finished my two half burgers and nibbled some of the fries.

The seating is all typical, bright hue plastic. The tables are laminate. The indoor seating area was on the small side, but there is a beautiful park nearby that would make a for a wonderful setting to eat in. I couldn't help but notice the floor and all the tables were littered with food and pieces of food packaging. I hope we came at the end of a rush and they hadn't had a chance to clean it up.

Overall, I would return again for the burgers, a very good ginger ale and a fry."

My experience was that great. It comes at a cost but the expense is well worth it if you're looking for a new place to try and have a good budget. Fancy date for a seafood lover? I GOT YOUR CHOICE RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE PLACE.

The food - I love seafood so much. Their oyster flight trio was such an adventure for my taste buds. All the dishes we had looked great, they tasted fantastic, even microwaved the following morning was a revisit to the night before in my mind.

The service - amazing, efficient, well spaced visits, well dressed and well mannered. It was almost like they had perfected their craft in addition to seeming properly staffed.

The atmosphere - low light, music selection is very solid, knew more than a few of the songs and the volume was perfect, it was a narrow path with a cramped feeling but I feel that adds to the charm of the establishment.

My dishes tasted - Single Oyster raw, Trio Oyster sampler, Seafood Chowder, Seafood Laska, Dry Apple Cider.We decided to do a wine tasting and oyster experience. 2 Dozen oysters and tasting 3 wines. It was fantastic! Oysters were Fanny Bay, and amazing (Go easy on the Horseradish). I know  red wines were a stretch, but that is why we did it! The mission Hill Happy Hour special, seemed to hold up the best. Happy Hour was just that! One of our best outings!Amazingly delicious!

Came on a tiny plate (I had to ask for a normal size one) and disintegrated as soon as I picked it up. To top it off: does not include fries."
ChIJlXglubh1j1QR1pavRMwq3-w,Nowhere *A Restaurant,4.6,48.4241086,-123.3650299,218,"We had a fantastic experience here with an amazing 6-courses meal and wine pairing.

Each course uses fresh local ingredients to the maximum extent and is presented in an extremely creative way. The wine pairing also matches the meal very well, maximizing the deliciousness of the ingredients.

The owners explained the ingredients, origin and taste of each dish in detail for us. The owners also detail the origin and distillery for each drink, as well as describe its taste and why each wine matches the meal.

Every course is very delicious, the dining experience is extremely great, highly recommended!This was an amazing 8 course meal. We arrived and ordered drinks. Each course was a surprise and delivered to us with an explanation of what we were having and where it came from. Everything was delicious and unique. There is a new tasting menu every month and we can not wait to go again. Highly recommend.Read the reviews and had reservations of what my food will be like. However, was surprised that it was actually very decent! Food was really good. Flavours were adventuress and wild! Not your everyday steak and seafood restaurant.

Only negative is that it's definitely not the cheapest thing, however, I can see that there was a lot of thought put into every dish.Delicious food and wonderful service.  We had 2 tasting menus and shared the wine pairing. Every dish was great and we had a wonderful introduction to each dish  and the restaurant from the owners wife who was serving tables that day. Everyone was so warm, we‚Äôll definitely be coming back!The good: nicely presented dishes and friendly staff, and a few very nice wines as part of the pairing option for the tasting menu. Generous desert portion and fun conversation with the servers, who also seem to be the cooks. Many nice touches‚Äîfried garlic and ginger and chili flakes on the fried chicken, for instance. Lots of variety in flavors throughout the meal‚Äîmiddle eastern, Caribbean, French, Asian, etc. all contributed.

The bad: the food itself was just ok. The service was good, but the food was slow‚Äîwe were waiting long enough between courses that we were starting to doze off at the table.

There were distracting and/or weird aspects of most of the dishes. We really liked the flavor of the mushroom dish‚Äîfried king oyster slices on a bed of pur√©ed cauliflower with coffee and chocolate with a very nice veggie demiglace‚Äîbut the actual mushrooms themselves were stringy and tough. The smoked fish with veggies marinated in shrimp paste was interesting, but overly heavy and salty‚Äîbright pickled cucumbers helped but weren‚Äôt enough to overcome the heaviness and muddled flavors. The beef tenderloin had great flavor, but also had a big chunk of sinew down the side which made for a very chewy experience.

The wines, overall, were mostly fun and nicely varied. But, they leaned a little heavily toward the funky/weird side, which got a little tiring later in the meal.

Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a bad meal, but for the price (and based on the other reviews) I was disappointed. Most high end tasting menu experiences I‚Äôve had at this price point have been better."

If you like Thai food?
This is the place to be!
Great service, excellent food, good price and delicious flavours.
Sookie always welcomes you with a smile.

There is a lot of choice.
And they also have their own spicy pepper sauce for 12,50.
Try it and buy it!
You can find it also in stores in Victoria.
The best!!Wow!! Amazing quality of food and a really exotic palette of flavors‚Ä¶ Thai food this good is hard to come by. Truly artesanal in craftsmanship both visually and in taste. Also, plentiful serving sizes!

The servers were nothing but friendly and had wonderful suggestions. The only complaint I had was that with menu offerings at these prices, it seems a bit gimmicky to charge extra for things like plain rice‚Ä¶ while I understand charging for it, I think it should come with the larger curry dishes, especially considering the already steep pricing.

Nonetheless, a really memorable restaurant experience and this place is often packed to the tee - expect a long wait and come hungry!We ordered 5 dishes, they looked great but all were too salty for us. But I love the atmosphere here.WOW! Would return and would highly recommend!! Flavours, freshness, portion sizes are just perfect. Probably the best Thai I have had since living in North America for 18months! Cannot wait to return when back in the area ü§§
We also ordered the Chicken Satay, Fresh Juice, cocktails (not pictured)
Everything was sensational. Come here and have a great experience. Maggie was also an awesome server üòéReally good service to start, i really appreciate it!
I was disappointed about the starters ( fish balls, spring roll and banana roll) . It was more like what you can find in a cheap buffet so i would try a salad as a starter next time.
We had a hot crying tiger ( a bit overcooked but nothing too crazy) , a hot chicken green curry, deep fried pork ( this one was dry but really tasty) and a red chicken curry with coconut rice on side as main courses
I was really suprised by the size and we brought leftovers home. It was really good so it kinda balance with those bad starters
I would love to had some green onions, cilantro and lime on the table for toppings .
Cocktails are really good and you can have a nice bottle of cab sav for 20 $ wich is great as well.
We appreciate the experience and with some changes, especially on the starters side i would definitely put 5 stars!"

All five in our group thoroughly enjoyed our meals. The pancakes were fluffy the fruit was fresh and service friendly. It took a little while for our food to come out but it was worth the wait. I would definitely recommend coming here for brunch and will be back! The prices are also very reasonable.Tried this spot for the first time, food was fantastic and good experience overall.

We went here on a Sunday morning at 9 and there was plenty of tables available.
We were greeted right away and offered water to start.

Once we had our orders placed, it took a bit of time for our food to arrive. There seemed to be two cooks in the kitchen. The food arrived and it was worth the longer wait. It had good flavour and was well presented.

I recommend this as a weekend breakfast spot!I just had the Avalon Skillet and it was large, delicious and great value. The eggs were well cooked, and tasty. The homemade oat bread was delicious and I loved the strawberry compote thingy to go with it was nice. The potatoes were also nice and crispy. I will come back with friends and family.My new favourite breakfast place. It‚Äôs a small greasy-spoon style diner, run by a family. The portions are large, the staff are amazingly friendly and the coffee is refillable. It was very busy the day we went and the staff/family was obviously struggling to keep up, but you could tell they were trying their best and everyone waited patiently. All around this place is amazing and I will go back many times.Fantastic food and service!! Must eat here! Eggs Benny were delicious, pancakes light and fluffy and the skillet was incredibly tasty!! Did I mention the potatoes!?? They have got to be the best and most delicious potatoes ever!! Crispy outside, soft and tender inside, perfectly seasoned!!! Amazing they are all homemade! 10 stars!! Server was super attentive and kind! And great for Pokemonners since there's a stop out front and we made a new friend from the restaurant!"

The service was excellent and situational aware. We ordered 3 different appetizers to share and they all came really fast. Then for the main course we had lamb and scallop risotto. I have to admit that everything was delicious. I would love to come back soon!I went for my Partners birthday. It was our first time here, and we will definitely be returning. The atmosphere was great with the amazing views of the Harbour, and the food was amazing.

We shared the bread&butter and the Humboldt squid appetizers(get the squid, seriously). Then, she had the scallop w/mushroom risotto, and I had the lamb.

It's definitely a place to check out .What an awesome suggestion by our wonderful realtor Dane Kingsbury of Victoria ( I need to write him a review next). Our excellent server Nevin made our lunch a really great one .  We were a group of 7 so open table wouldn't let me book 7 so I booked 4 and 3 and when I arrived and explained to the lovely hostess she found us 2 booths (back to back) with panoramic water views. The food was fantastic and I thought for the price....it was very reasonable. The salads were crisp and fresh, my son loved his wagyu beef burger, steaks were done with perfection, mussels divine ( Nevin brought us a spoon as he gave us a great tip cause the broth is incredible) . Thank for such a great dining experience and kudos to Nevin....he even gave us a good recommendation for his barber üòÜ.Went for brunch today as I‚Äôve seen the brunch menu and was intrigued by the Braised Short Rib Hash. The brunch menu has a good selection of items with several options of Eggs Benedict and several other delicious sounding items but I was there for the Hash. I like to order any breakfast item with Hollandaise on the side so I can add as much or little as I want, plus I want to see the food before it‚Äôs covered in sauce. The meal arrived and it did not disappoint! The eggs were poached a perfect medium, the potato hash browns were crispy on the outside and fluffy inside (they looked homemade but I can‚Äôt say for sure and forgot to ask) and the aged cheddar was a nice touch. The star of the dish was the braised short rib - amazing! And they did not skimp on the portion! Every mouthful was flavorful and delicious! It was one of those memorable dishes that will bring me back.

On a related note, I was at B&B a week or so ago for Happy Hour  with my sister and mother and we enjoyed a selection of items from the Happy Hour menu and to say we enjoyed them immensely is an understatement. Unfortunately I didn‚Äôt get any pics but next time I go for their Happy Hour I‚Äôll be sure to get some good picsWe celebrated a family birthday here, and everything was excellent!
The service exceeded expectations, as did the food!
We each had something different, and it was all well plated and very tasty!
The staff were very welcoming, and it was very enjoyable to eat in a place where you know everyone is fully vaccinated :-)
I would highly recommend Boom + Batten for any occasion, even if it is just an excuse to eat out.
Great view from every table, and some wonderful outside seating when the weather improves."

Appreciated the gluten free bread option but likely wouldn‚Äôt go back.Really unfortunate the management now is behaving like such a rude individual. I loved all of my previous experiences, always good times. However seems something has changed???
Most unpleasant interaction with some form of management attempting to make his opinion known about his burned nachos being how we should enjoy them. Wow. I‚Äôve always enjoyed their nachos- but burning the top and nothing even melted underneath seems to be the new norm?? Hope not‚úåüèª

WowzaThis is a fabulous hole in the wall for small plates to share and unique drink specials. My favorite lately is their double gin and tonic (especially happy hour). Good non-alcoholic options available too!Pretty cool selection of crafted cocktails. Worth the $$$. Food is ok. The groove is very different. If you haven't been, you should definitely give it a go. It may become your new ""Go TO"" place in Victoria. I'll be back!Cozy little bar tucked away under the stairs in the heart of downtown. tasty cocktails and great atmosphere.

ChIJW3dgD0F0j1QRvbo0aoM6woE,The Oaks Restaurant and Tearoom,4.3,48.4265983,-123.3142145,425,"A classic restaurant and tea house with considerable local history. Relatively inexpensive with tasty daily specials, each of which has ample proportions. All tea pots are a good size and come with Royal Dalton bone china and a memorable tea spoon. Several wines and beers to match many tastes plus live music Friday evenings. Well worth the visit.This is a very unique place! Oldest building in Oak Bay. A YUGE menu, which can be daunting to get through, but everything we had was quite tasty! Fair prices, electric crowd, warm service. More than meets the eye!Went there on a Sunday, just me. They took forever to seat me. I ordered a coffee and the shortrib eggs benny, the first mug she gave had a lipstick mark on which was replaced when asked. The eggs benny there was plenty of shortrib but lacking of flavor and salt! I don't usually add extra salt after food is served but I had to. The only tasty thing was their parmesan potatoes! I would try a dinner to give them another chance.The interior is warm but if you are coming here for good service or good food..... GO ELSEWHERE!!
We waited for over 10 minutes before a waitress came to our table. She was rude, not helpful and dismissive. When we finally got our meal she forgot the cream for my tea and although I reminded her she didn't bring it. I finally asked another woman if I could have some.
I also asked 3 times for the jam I had told her I wanted when I gave her my original order. Although she said yes twice, it never appeared. One of the worst breakfasts I've had and the Welsh rarebit that my partner had was not edible. After all this when we asked for the check she didn't bring it. We finally went to the bar to pay it. Needless to say with no tip, which rarely happens with us. We are 20% tippers.
I would never eat here again......nor should you üòÇLove this place. We have been twice in our first four days here on the island. Friday night for fish and chips and French onion soup, then on Monday for Full Tea and the Original Burger and fries. The place is a nice old fashioned pub, with a white exterior and large black beams. Inside is full of great old tables and chairs.
Our food was wonderful every time we went.
I had been looking for a place with the English pub feeling and Afternoon Tea at a fair price. They have several Tea choices, full tea was only $28!"

We had the strawberry but the orange flavour also sounds amazing.First time visit
Fresh quality ingredients,  quick and friendly service
Had a cheese burger and the crush fries. Great flavor on both. If you are looking for something quick with great flavor give this place a tryLOOKING FOR A BURGER THAT LOOKS AND TASTES AS GOOD AS THE COMMERCIALS? üçîü§§

Burger Crush has a cute diner vibe with a simple menu - cheeseburgers. I ordered the vegan burger and it was delicious. Some vegan burgers make me feel like I‚Äôm missing something, but this burger did a really good job of satisfying my burger needs. The patty is housemade, had some nice crunch and ingredients felt fresh. My partner got the normal cheeseburger and really enjoyed it as well.

This is the definition of how simple is good. The burger is a good size and it‚Äôs just under $30 for 2 people, which is pretty reasonable. It also doesn‚Äôt leave you feeling sluggish or greasy like how some fast food places leave me feeling.

Overall, I‚Äôd definitely reccomended checking this place out if you‚Äôre strolling Victoria and craving a burger!Had a veggie burger with all the toppings, a side of crush fries, and tofu nuggets. The nuggets are by far the best vegetarian nuggets I've ever had. The food was excellent and the service was cheerful. Space is very limited and food is pricey, what that's on par with everywhere these days. I'd plan to get take-out here if you have a large group.It‚Äôs just perfect. Only advice for owners is to get some outside seating.

Shake 10/10
Burger 10/10 - maybe fry onions more and a little more salt on meat
Crush fries 10/10

Loved it all"

Food was absolutely incredible! Most outstanding dish for us was the pork belly appetizer! Everything else was so beautifully presented and all the flavors were on point making it a full on sensory experience -highly recommendüëåüëçüëçI‚Äôve been holding off on posting a review because I really dislike leaving bad reviews. My partner and I went to Saveur during Taste of Victoria. We are both adventurous eaters, and we like a wide variety of tastes.  Our dinner was probably one of my least favourite meals that I‚Äôve ever had - it was genuinely not good (in addition to being very expensive, but we knew that in advance). For Taste of Victoria, there was a set menu so I ordered one appetizer and entree, and my partner ordered the other choices. We did not enjoy any dish. The highlight of our meal was the pickled radish that was on the side of Skate dish, which speaks to the quality of the rest of the food. The service was fine. We were really excited to try here after seeing the amazing reviews but it was a very disappointing experience.Worth the splurge!!!  Yes it's expensive. And yes it was amazing! Good things are worth spending money on and if you've never had a fine dining meal, this should be on your local list to try! Service was attentive and on point. The meals were paired wonderfully with reds and whites appropriately. We started off with a super fun creative chai inspired whiskey sour! If James has it available, order it!!! When they say their tenderloin is like butter, it's true. And yes, you should pair wine with your dessert!
It's a small venue, with small tables but the service keeps on top of your table helping to avoid clutter. Thanks Chef, James, and Ryan for the great time!Nice french restaurant with an Asian twist. The food is all very pretty and the service is great (prob cuz they add an 18% service charge regardless of the no. of people in your group).

The food is on the pricier end but it's is pretty good. I especially liked the pork belly.Great food and wonderful service! The flavours were delicate and well balanced, yet super flavourful and unique. The presentation was beautiful. The service was great; We took our time and didn't feel rushed."

Good ambience, with some really nice art work on the brick wall, with an open kitchen where there‚Äôs also chairs where you can sit.  We were seated by the window, and we have a very nice and accommodating server, her name is Lilly. She‚Äôs very nice and can joke around. It was a nice experience dining in this restaurant,  Highly recommended.  Thank you for the great hospitality and for the great food! We will be back!Ferris‚Äô is a fantastic little spot that‚Äôs become my go-to when in Victoria. A fantastic selection of oysters and other dishes in a quaint little spot upstairs. On my most recent visit we enjoyed the set menu with wine pairings as part of Dine Around Victoria and were very pleased with all the dishes offered and the service was fantastic as always. Definitely recommend a reservation as it‚Äôs a small place!Loved the food, especially scallops and bouillabaisse. Oysters are fresh, but smaller than what served up the island. Overall, very happy with the experience.

The staff was very nice to us.We decided to have a nice dinner and chose one of the best rated places in Victoria. So expectations were high. What we received:
- oysters were warm and even dry. They were provided in seconds after our order. How long they stayed open?
- pasta was perfectly prepared al dente, but the cheese, omg - it was not a cheese, it was some plastic bag. U can see it in pic;
- the waitress was nice, but very in a hurry. She recommended a perfect local Pinot gri, but it was WARM:
- we loved interior- very nicely done roofing, windows, walls, but  PLEASE take away the so called art from the walls. Just small advise - less is more!
- at the end we received a bill. It would be ok to pay such amount for Normal European restaurant. But, dear Canadian friends - European price goes with the  quality of food. What we experienced today - was   1* Michelin restaurant price for regular American burger quality. Actually, yesterday we had a very good chorizo burger at Town square restaurant in Pemberton. That burgers quality was better than had to be ours on of the best dishes in Victoria.

Overall, the restaurant is overrated.Loved the happy hour! They have good specials on drinks and food.

The oysters were $2 each and were pretty fresh. The chorizo and hony puffs were also very tasty!"

Service was fantastic from the beginning, greeted and orders taken quickly. Once ordered our food arrived fairly quick considering the amount of people dining in and orders for take out.

We had fruit juice (mango) and it was tasty. For our meal we had the spicy lemongrass chicken spring roll and Lemon grass chicken vermicelli.
All the portions were reasonable for the portion size. The food itself looked very presentable and was enjoyable.

I highly recommend trying this place out to get your Vietnamese meal fix!Like a glimpse of paradise - a babbling brook, a cooling breeze, a lush garden. Never did I think I would find baby dill fish cake and tofu soup here on the Island. Broth was exceptional. Beef broth tastes like pure marrow, probably the best I've had in a long while. Kind and attentive service, what more could you want?the restaurant is very nicely decorated with relaxing music. The service was excellent, pretty quick and attentive, though they seem slightly busy as there were several other tables to serve. We ordered pork rolls, lemongrass chicken, house special and curry chicken. The food was also served within a reasonable time frame. The food was awesome! Taste great and the owner is Vietnamese -- some authentic dishes! Would definitely come again if possible!Great service and the flavours in the curry are delicious! Restaurant is clean and there is a patio for outdoor dining. Recommend a refreshing Vietnamese coffee for dessert.Cute place and friendly staff but the food was average."
ChIJU9XGCFxzj1QRRf9vmaJNXas,Lum's Chinese Restaurant,4.2,48.430294,-123.401594,378,"First time ordering from Lum's since I'm in Victoria for the week. I ordered some plain chowmein (just chowmein with beansprouts) and some spring rolls. I'll start with the chowmein which was good on flavor, a great portion size, but the noodles were slightly too thick for me. Now this is more of a personal preference but I prefer skinnier noodles as its easier to eat. I'm not knocking the dish, just that thick noodles isn't my preference. The spring rolls however, oh dam, they were delicious! Not to mention the low price they are, I should have ordered more. Highly recommend the spring rolls.This place is great, I ordered typical fair, Pork fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mein,  some Ginger fried beef and sweet and sour pork.  We had a shell fish allergy in our party and the chef was eager to accommodate and removed the oyster sauce.  The people were super kind and grateful

everyone behind the counter was working like crazy, Awesome food, worth the price.Great price/quantity ratio, I find the quality of the meat better than others Chinese restaurants in town :) aaand great service, always smiling!The sweet and sour pork was hard as rock. The chicken was way more breading than actual chicken. The noodles were meh, but not bad.
The food could definitely be better, but it could just be that one time. I will come back to give it another chance when I‚Äôm in town but for now... 3 stars.I ordered Chicken Chowmein and Sweet and Sour Pork. Both were ready very quickly as they were having a slow night and were normal sized portions. The chow mein only had about 3 small pieces of chicken and was quite heavily doused in soy sauce but the noodles were good quality and well cooked. The Sweet and Sour Pork was all pork, no vegetables, which was a surprise but not unwelcomed and was quite tasty. My only issue was later that evening I suffered a pretty devastating bowel movement and felt quite painfully sick. This was the only food or drink (other than filtered water) I had consumed for many hours and would have been the only cause of my upset stomach. It was a shame as this could have been my go to Chinese food place in Victoria but I'm not a fan of restaurants that give me food poisoning."

I had the freshly cooked mussels, they were amazing, afterwards the warm Reuben sandwich which I also enjoyed. The bread pudding was delicious.Came here based on Google reviews and we were NOT disappointed. Probably the best tasting Ceasar salad I've had in years. Falafel burger was super tasty as well.We ate here 2 days in a row! It was convenient located in the heart of James Bay. Atmosphere was wonderful, menu items were plentiful and food was over the top! Live music twice a week people! Great little place to visit and will now be our go to place for eats!!!My recent visit to this restaurant left me with some disappointment. The noise level inside the establishment was so high that having a conversation became quite challenging. It created an uncomfortable and chaotic dining experience.

Furthermore, the food did not meet my expectations. Specifically, the chicken in the chicken burger lacked flavor and tasted predominantly like bread. The absence of a distinct chicken taste was disappointing. To enhance the flavor, we had to request hot sauce to dip the chicken in.

While this restaurant has room for improvement, it's important to consider that individual experiences can vary.I absolutely love Heron Rock! Best Chicken and Waffles Eggs Benny in town. Tucked away in James Bay with a warm friendly atmosphere and the loveliest staff, definitely worth a visit! I would highly suggest brunch, they serve all week until 3pm. Chefs Choice Triple Benny is a great way to explore the menu or for people who can't decide and like a surprise. The chef will make you three different Benny's of their choosing and it's been super yummy every time! If you're feeling like a Cesar or Mimosa, Heron Rock has a fantastic list of all kinds of Cesar's to try as well as their ""Manmosa""."
