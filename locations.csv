ChIJ1e5UJJF0j1QR6VpPNf8TYiQ,Royal BC Museum,4.6,48.4198111,-123.3674497,8661,"Great museum has very nice and extensive exhibits. I went there when they had the wildlife photo-journalism exhibit which was a interesting one. It wasn‚Äôt busy whatsoever but I did go on a rainy Sunday around 3:00. Would definitely recommend going. It also seems like there was a third floor exhibit but for some reason it‚Äôs closed and I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe it will be open sometime in the future.
The Grand Dame of Museums in Victoria, BC.  In the heart of the city; next to the Iconic Empress Hotel and across from the Famed Victoria Harbour. The displays in the different themed exhibits are awesome! The extensive information and detail in the displays is fabulous. Plan on spending a minimum of three hours; more, if your a history buff!
This is one of the best museums we have visited. It has natural history, art, First People cultural history, and an interactive town/ship/ mine from British colonial history. Really great. Two weeks ago,  that section was closed for remodel. I'm hoping it is still as awesome as ever when it reopens.
Great place to visit and learn about the ice age and stuff. They even had a showing of covid portraits which was cool.

Likes: it was cheap. $5 per person and it was absolutely worth it. Lots to see and learn.

Dislikes: Nothing I can think of
Must visit!! But set aside at least 3 hours for this place. On Saturdays(Summers I think) they are open until 10pm, which worked in our favour.There is so much information to absorb in limited time. During our visit - The first floor was dedicated for First Nations, Second floor of Animal evolution, Third floor was set aside for Stu the dinosaur (T-Rex fossil discovered in Canada) and the related discoveries. We also had the opportunity to visit -The Angkor wat display- which was excellent, but many of the idols were missing parts while on exhibition :(. The museum is well-maintained, clean, wheelchair accessible and has very friendly staff.

ChIJmXc0Z6J0j1QR4CJUS73dyZk,Fisherman's Wharf Park,4.5,48.42195,-123.3830139,7523,"A popular tourist attraction on the Victoria waterfront, near the floating homes (not houseboats). There are multiple food vendors, some of which also sell alcohol. Not all businesses were open on a Sunday evening.

Expect crowds, but a fun spot to find and enjoy the waterfront, especially at sunset.

Water taxis available to take you anywhere around the harbor for $12/person one way. There is a parking lot near the children's playground.

The area is walking distance to Old Town.

There is one restroom on the dock.
Man,we loved this place!!! Great tiny little restaurants and bars on the water across from a marina. Heads up, some of these quaint little houses are available through Air BnB so check before you book a hotel. You can walk right into the heart of the city from there. Beautiful views at night when all the lights come on. Worth the visit. You will need at least three or more days to take in all that is offered in this city. Enjoy!
Lovely place with colourful buildings on the water. In the place you can see restaurants, ice cream shop, galleries and houses. There are public washrooms in the place. Really nice atmosphere. Next to the place there is a big lawn and small playground. There is a pay parking lot and free parking spots on the street. Highly recommended to visit here.
This is pretty. Unfortunately we were there on a rainy day. I like colors of shops and houses. I wonder what benefit private home owners get bit allowing visitors walk besides their homes? I do not think it is fun to live there were you would be on the public eyes all the time. I liked seeing houses, shops and water taxes, a pretty picture. We had fish and fries and I did not enjoy fish at all. It was fish with very bland batter and was not tasty at all atheist for me.  Overall it is a mist visit place for sure.
Beautiful place üòç  . With floating  houses  . And restaurants  . Its a must see in Victoria  . Its got Washrooms and car / bike   parking  and nearby public transportation.    . Its nice marina  .  And green park with a kids play ground and  picnic tables and Adirondack chairs  .  Note its fall season  not every restaurant or business is open here ,but still some  are open here even in fall season  .   The pizza  ,gifts  shop ,the candy shop are closed  . The ferry boat does  stops here  .   Summer  looks more lively for this place in terms of places here being open .   Thier is one house boat B&B   but the rest of the  floating houses are definitely not open to public they are private residents  but people can walk on the open docks to view them . Its pay parking  . And free  bicycle parking.

ChIJueKTCmtzj1QRxJZTfhNWlsY,Esquimalt Gorge Park & Pavilion,4.7,48.4463446,-123.4049493,1078,"This park is so lovely! City staff do a great job with upkeep. There is lots of parking (including disabled spot and EV charging), picnic tables for small and large groups, lighting, playground, washrooms and water fountains, a paved walking path along the water with benches for sitting and taking in the view of wildlife or people on the water, and even a beach. Swimming not really recommend here as there is a lot of goose poop. Large green space and also an off leash dog area. The Japanese Garden is gorgeous and the new Pavillion is also a beautiful building. This would be an excellent location for a wedding.
Such a great place!!! This park is a local treasure!!! Wonderful landscaping with a nice path system bordered by gorgeous flowers and shrubs. The new building will be a fantastic addition to this and ib look forward to its opening!!!
July 23/2022. 23¬∞C. The Esquimalt Gorge Park goes back a long way with Japanese history with a small garden that will
captivate you because of it's design. When we were there numerous small craft were getting ready to push off to go exploring.
You must walk here to visit and enjoy. No parking until done construction.. Beautiful japanese gardens, has more potential as its being upgraded and im sure once the new centre is done the gardens will be looked after..
It‚Äôs a very beautiful park. Found a sculpture exhibition going on which was breathe taking . Nice place to go on a walk by the water ways

ChIJ5ZScPpF0j1QRBLCY8tTvWsM,Thunderbird Park,4.3,48.4197936,-123.3666803,203,"Like the totems and of course worth visiting the place once.. free and just in. The corner of street. U can visit that while walking to beach hill park
It's a minimalist location. More of a park with heritage to experience. It's changed over the years. There used to be more totems but things get old and totems are supposed to degrade over time. It's great that our indigenous people have a place to display their heritage. I always enjoy seeing the display here. I hope it continues.
What a great collection of amazing Indigenous artwork! There are several totem poles of various designs all within close proximity to one another. If you're in Victoria, you should take the time to walk through the park and check out these totem poles!
Easy walk to, right beside museum and empress.
Interesting poles, some slightly phallic in design üôà

ChIJS9YYcJB0j1QRPWHIFtwTr18,Victoria Bug Zoo,4.5,48.4232996,-123.3666683,1822,"My daughter and I had a fantastic time at the bug zoo. It‚Äôs a bit smaller than I was expecting but there are a lot of bugs to see!

My favorite part of the zoo were the people. I‚Äôve genuinely never went to a place where every single person working there seemed like they found their calling. The workers are passionate about bugs and it shows! It was such a fun experience for my little one learn and touch some bugs!
What a great place to visit with or without kids. Our group - 6 adults enjoyed our experience very much. From the moment we walked in we were greeted with a warm welcome and once we were ready we were taken to another room with all the creapy crawlies. At the time they had 2 lovely ladies explaining and answering any and all questions from visitors. Both ladies loved what they did as they talked with such love and passion for the animals which made me very comfortable being around spiders and other crawly critters. I would definitely recommend the Bug Zoo!
This is a wonderful little zoo filled with charismatic arthropods. The staff are charismatic, too, and happy to adjust the information they give based on how familiar you are with their many-legged friends. So whether you‚Äôre a kid or an adult, bug-shy or bug enthusiast, there‚Äôs something here that will make you smile.
This site is amazing to visit. Staff members were extremely helpful and kind. This location is undoubtedly fun for kids. I had an amazing time at this exhibit and was blown away by the variety of creatures.
Two small rooms about exhibiting different species of bugs charging ~$50 for two adults and one kid. No offence, but a lot of the exhibition boxes were empty (in construction), however it is a bit much for not so much content. The gift shop was bigger than the exhibition rooms

ChIJa4uQ3-p0j1QRDtSaFQ5NHrQ,Beacon Hill Park,4.7,48.4122222,-123.3627779,8434,"This is a beautiful and well thought-out park. There is a really tall totem pole, a tennis court, a lawn bowling (croquet for the Americans), a long beach walk, a series of groomed, wood chip trails through woods as well as concrete and a children's playground.

While we were there we were lucky to come across a peacock, sparring for crumbs with a squirrel and an owl we interrupted the lunch hunt for. There were many birds, squirrels and creatures talking and singing as we walked through the woods. The beach trails is impressively long and gorgeous. There are many flowers still blooming in mid-June along the walking path. There is an unfenced, grassy area between the road and the beach path where dogs are allowed off leash. On the path, they are requested to be on-leash.

The park is not large but packs a lot in for the space it takes. I would highly recommend a visit.

Parking is free for up to three hours and thirty minutes. Washrooms are available in a brick and mortar building and are automatically flushing. They are gendered however.
This is one of the coolest city parks I've been to. It seems to shift in ecosystem so drastically as you walk through it. It is well maintained and the park staff have been very open to questions. It is a lovely way to make your way to the shore, with many different paths to explore. The summer concert series was absolutely delightful, and I look forwards to next year. Be warned: there is a lot of water fowl poop in some areas, so look before you sit!
One of the best parks here in Victoria. The best for joggers and cyclists. The Beacon Hill Children' s farm in here is a major attraction for kids and adults with a petting zoo. This beautiful park is full of majestic dancing peacocks , Goose's and Ducks and tonnes of Herons
Amazing sight to behold here. The peacocks,  Canadian geese, and cranes fill the air with noise. The pathways and restroom facility are well maintained. The big trees, willows, and unique vegetation make for plenty of sights. Go to the beach after your walk in the park for an amazing contrast of nature.
Beautiful park.  Now that there isn't any tents everywhere you can appreciate the beauty of the park again!

They have ponds everywhere, and flower gardens that are well maintained, and the wildlife has returned to the park. Highly recommend coming to the park for an hour. Lots of space to read a book or just enjoy life.

ChIJQRgei5B0j1QRPcfjFwsz8Rc,Miniature World,4.6,48.4223763,-123.3669183,2222,"This place is so freaking cool. I thought it was maybe going to be a tourist trap but I'm so glad I went in. I can't even imagine the amount of work it must've taken to craft all these miniature scenes. Incredible amount of detail and so fun to look at. I loved that it was interactive with buttons to make things move and light up! If you're on the fence about visiting, do it!
I brought my children here and they were fascinated with all the detail and how they could see inside many buildings. The displays are brought to life with trains that move or figurines doing light action sequences. The interactive buttons to press for noises or commentary are a nice touch as well. Staff were very courteous and helpful. It's great to see that this place is still available for us inquisitive adults and the little ones in our lives. We will be back next year.
This place is great! Price is fairly affordable, and the detail in these dioramas is insane! If you don't care for details, you might blow through this place pretty quickly. But if you take your time to look at all the intricate details you can easily spend an hour or more here. Some of the displays have interactive buttons that make things happen on the diorama itself which is pretty cool. I think the only thing that would be cool is if they had some modern-day dioramas as well as all the old historic stuff.
Went on a Sunday, there was no line up.
Outside is deceiving, once you go through you realize how big the museum is. It's interactive great for all ages.
Great history lesson with a little fairytale fun as well.
Highly recommend!
Really enjoyed our trip to Miniature World. The thing I loved the most was not only was each display really detailed, there were descriptions above each display depicting what it was with some historical information too.

Personally highlight was the Canadian railway stretching from Vancouver in the west to the Atlantic coast in the East.

ChIJVyJLu1Jxj1QRb_Xb-OS2DDM,Cadboro-Gyro Park,4.7,48.4597261,-123.2945546,2267,"Amazing beachfront park with soft sand and a great playground. Perfect for a picnic with several tables. An ideal place for families with kids. The playground has swings for little kids and big kids, a few climbable sea monsters and sea creatures, and a great pirate ship with a plank! Most importantly, there is a washroom right next to the play area with water bottle refill station and rinse-off station for sandy little toes. Our son loved this park and so did we!
One of the best playgrounds I‚Äôve been to! Octopus slides, whale and sea serpent climbing structures, and many more ocean-themed original creations. The beach itself is sandy and clean. What a beautiful park!
Beautiful park and beach. It has everything that a family can enjoy. I can spend a whole day in that park. Love that they also have zipline.
Our favourite beach and park to visit when in Victoria. While busy at times, the beach has a tranquil vibe. Great for kids and for chill get-togethers with friends and family.
Cadboro Gyro Park is a great place to visit in Victoria, British Columbia. It has a beautiful beach with soft sand and a section for dogs and another section for kids to play without dogs. The playground is really fun and boasts a kiddie zip line. There are also picnic tables and a large grassy area with washrooms.¬†It‚Äôs a great family park at the beach with free parking lot

ChIJ13vUgIp0j1QRbx3mZXLZILI,Craigdarroch Castle,4.5,48.42262940000001,-123.3437226,4838,"This is a neat, old castle that was built well over a hundred years ago. Unfortunately they were not allowing tours when we visited as repairs had to be made. That said, parking on the street is free and walking the grounds is as well. There is a large, grassy area on the north side that the neighborhood kids were playing football in.

If you can get here for a tour, I think it would be well worth the fee. As is, I was able to enjoy some kids making use of the acoustics of one of the openings below parking level and snap several photos. There is a lot of history in Victoria and this is just one example.
This mammoth of a mansion is a must visit in Victoria. The place was originally built for Robert Dunsmuir and his wife Joan Dunsmuir in the late 1800's and is now open for tours. It gives us a glimpse of how privileged life used to be in olden times. The Castle Society has done a great job collecting all the newspaper references, history of the bungalow and its transformation across the years. The ticket cost was $39/person and I strongly recommend wearing masks for people with dust allergies. Sadly this place is not wheelchair accessible probably because the structure has only three floors of rooms and is too old to be modified to have accommodated a lift. There is free parking inside the Castle compound. However, if you are planning to park outside, make sure you park within the yellow curb line mark or you will get a ticket(for people new to Canada).
I grew up going to this castle for my sisters music lessons, so it was so interesting to tour it and see it in all its historically restored glory. It's beautiful,  inside and out. Details are given for you to read about the family that originally lived in it, and this was so interesting to read about.
Very surprised by this experience! I spent about 1.5 hours in here and well worth it. It is a self guided tour and really enjoyed being able to take my time.

It is an older building, so if there are concerns around accessibility it can be hard as there are only stairs in this.

Also, walked here from downtown Victoria and it was pleasant with a mini hill at the end, but not terrible.
The one activity planned today was to visit the Craigdarroch Castle ‚Äì more of a 5 story Victorian mansion. Frozen in time was a good description of the mansion as the ornately decorated rooms reflected the period. The map with information was an excellent guide as were the staff who offered us additional information as we went from floor to floor or asked if we had any questions. And the storyboards provided more information on the family, the building or its rich history (home, hospital, college, etc.). Excellent stained glass, wood work and tile. Thoroughly enjoyed the visit on this hot Mother‚Äôs Day.

ChIJqfezy7h0j1QRcGyaRtBl-o0,Holland Point Park,4.7,48.411122,-123.3761861,1052,"A nice park alongside the ocean, plenty of sitting areas to enjoy the views and ocean. A great place to get out and take a walk. I was out here when is was super windy and rainy nobody was around, the Waves were big and looked awesome üòéüëçüèº
The sound of Waves crashing is relaxing ‚ù§Ô∏è
Out on a sunny ‚òÄÔ∏èüòé Day is nice too.
More a walking path than a park but this beach front area is a must any time of the year to take in the classic views from Victoria.
I spent a year living close by. Every morning at dawn I would run along the breakwater from Ogden Point to Clover Point and count birds along the way. So far I've seen two Herons, incredibly a Harrier, uncountable Mergancers, sparrows, hummingbirds, mating displays, a large bird of prey, an eagle and a submarine. One of them was smaller than I had expected.
Absolutely love this area of Victoria. Moved to Victoria a few months ago and stayed at an Air BnB across the street from this park. It quickly became my favourite area to talk daily walks with the pup. Gorgeous coast line, plenty of places to sit and even walk down to the beach. Favourite part is watching the fog or a storm roll over the ocean. Definitely recommend walking the path!
Nice place to spontaneously jump out of the car and get some sea air

ChIJe6rc4Zp0j1QRGdn5alXwQtE,The Maritime Museum of British Columbia,3.8,48.4218702,-123.36631,165,"Its currently two big rooms  at this new location  .  They got a mini kids area here . Its not the big amount of museum collection like at the old location  but they are working on moving into a bigger location in  future &  the  government  needs to  help  them out better  . I always love the maritime museum of Victoria   and love supporting them üíó.     They currently got a fishing exhibit on .  The museum is LGTBQ+and wheelchair and pet friendly . And its free for kids under 12 and free for indigenous folks.
Kinda sad really.
There's a room, maybe 150 sq ft with some models of ships ( really nice models, very detailed some 4' long ).
Maybe 10 or 12 ships.
There's another room with some examples of knots sailers use.
There's a box with 1 side gravel and 1 side sand and some miniature examples of various types of anchors you can put in the gravel / sand and see how they grab the bottom.
That's about it.
$10.00 admission, we looked around and read the little info cards on the model ships and were out in about 20 minutes.
I was totally underwhelmed and disappointed. You'd think we could do better.
I am not really a big boat enthusiast but decided to check it out when they had an open house on Victoria day long weekend. I was pleasantly surprised to see a fabulous art show at the back of the museum (see attached pics) so it was well worth the visit for me. It is very small but it would take quite awhile to read and listen to everything they had on display there.
The absolute worst way to spend $21.00. It would have been more entertaining flushing my money down the toilet than visiting this museum. It consists of 2 small rooms, smaller than my bedroom. Very over-priced, left a lot to be desired. Needs improvement. After 5 minutes you have seen all there is to see. Don't waste your money.
As the other reviews have said... Very small. If the fee was maybe cheaper, it would be ok (and maybe attract more customers). Only went in for the Saturday themed playgroup which was good... If I paid just for the museum, it's not ok..

This park is well worth the visit. We‚Äôll groomed trails walk you through a historic military site with interpretive information and great views or Victoria and towards the Olympic Mountains. This is a high calibre (no pun intended) park with free parking and no entry fee. It‚Äôs dog friendly‚Ä¶ a real local gem.
A nice place for a quick walk along the water, some historic sites and a beautiful view of the mountains!
We stayed in an AirBnB right at the entrance of this park and it was stunning! You can watch the cruise ships come and go, as well as explore the old barracks. There is wildlife to watch, and very friendly locals walking their dogs.
Fabulous park that we almost missed out on. We were confused by the locked gate and no parking signs every where near the entrance. Glad we took a chance and parked further down the street. The park had lots of pathways leading to the water and along the water. This is a great place to walk your dog and/or enjoy great views of Juan de fuca straight. There are benches along the look outs and even a picnic area. The park signs say the park is only open from dawn to dusk however. Overall a really nice park well worth the visit.

ChIJD3Ob63xzj1QR5gnCaZM1_pQ,Point Ellice House,4.5,48.4362721,-123.3771518,87,"Lots to see in a small house museum.  A lot of ‚Äòthings‚Äô from the former owners were left behind when the home became a museum.  Tells the story of some lives of an earlier age.  Very knowledgeable volunteers.
It was a fascinating experience learning about the family who lived here years ago. The grounds aren't huge but there is still a lot to see and learn. The garden tour highlighted some neat features about the grounds and it's definitely worth taking.
For history enthusiasts! For locals and tourists! For fans of Victorian epoch! For anyone who‚Äôs fascinated by interior design! This place is a hidden gem! It‚Äôs so worth visiting! Pictures from the phone don‚Äôt do any justice to this stunning place! Staff is beyond amazing! They literally walked extra mile for us today. Guide was so lovely and extremely knowledgeable. Price is more than reasonable. Find the time to check this place! For high tea reservations are needed! Would love to come back!
Point Ellice House is a beautifully preserved piece of Victoria history and  is a truly unique treasure located on the Gorge Waterway very close to downtown. What makes this home so unique is that it remained in the hands of the same family for three generations with all of it‚Äôs original contents and without any substantial redecorations. What you will see, including the wall paper, the fixtures, the furnishings, and the china, is all original and covers the period from 1890 through 1920.  It provides a rare opportunity to see one of North America‚Äôs largest collections of late Victorian and early Edwardian objects in an original, untouched Victorian home. It is now a National Historic Site and well worth a visit.  If you make advanced reservations, you can have afternoon tea in the garden.
Definitely recommend checking out this museum. It's unique in that everything inside the house is from the original family, so it really feels like stepping back in time. The restoration of the grounds is very authentic as well. Going on the garden tour was very educational as the knowledgeable guide pointed out much of the plants and trees that are original to the house. The staff and volunteers are passionate about this historic place and warmly welcome you.

Benches and chairs facing the ocean.
Dog space, and a grassy area.
There is plenty of parking and the entire stretch has a walk path to walk and enjoy the beautiful sea and birds :)

The end of the park has a look out point and the starting of the walk path has a long pier to steps to walk down and enjoy the ocean waves even closer ! If you are lucky you will get to see some ships (pretty close) docked there !
Such a lovely place to enjoy the Strait and the mountains away to the south in the USA.  Great ""off leash"" dog area and every dog loves to go and play with the waves and the drift wood.
So beautiful!!! :) Im from Surrey, BC, so I never saw such a large body of water like this. It's one of the most beautiful things I've seen ever, I can't believe how gorgeous it was. Though mesmerizing, it was also very terrifying to just look at

Bit of a waste of time unless you went strictly for the view
No tickets required, no wait in the viewing area.
You only need about 10 minutes to see everything
Garbage can in the parking lot.
Hands down the absolute best observatory I‚Äôve been to all day. Will return for more sunrise-watching soon. Best wishes to all the dog walkers with their cute dogs. Walking your dog brings joy to so many people.
Not sure if this place is still in operation but the views are amazing from here. Little parking lot just a short walk to the observatory. There is construction going on in the area, be aware of the blast horn and the explosion afterwards. There was another couple there and they looked concerned but we explained to them what just happened as you can feel it through the ground hundreds of feet away. We really enjoyed the day here, would love to come at night to see if this place come alive.
Awesome views of the coast and very easy access, at least from the back. A bit more challenging up the slope from the front but there is a handrail on the steepest section. There are stairs and a rocky path up. Just be careful especially if wet or in poorly lit conditions.
Great views of Victoria from the Observatory‚Ä¶..nearly 360 degrees. Observatory is not open to the public, but there are several benches to enjoy the view. Dog friendly.

Today I visited and the wet logs/rocks were slippery. The water was cold (as always). And the trails were covered in natural fauna!! Saw a duck.
We had a great visit, geocaching and taking photos and looking and listening for birds. Everything was wet as we just missed the rain. This is one of our favourite parks to explore.
Nice little waterfront park just jam-packed with Garry Oak trees. It‚Äôs a really nice bit of wilderness in the middle of the city. The park is largely undeveloped and, as such, is brimming local with plant and animal life. It‚Äôs a great place for a picnic or a stroll. Definitely worth a visit if you‚Äôre in the area and looking for a quiet place to be in nature.
I've lived in Oak Bay for 8 years and never visited this amazing park. It's like a beautiful wilderness right in the city. So many trails to wander easily along; it doesn't matter whether you go left or right at the fork, you never get lost. You are alone (perhaps with your dog, off-leash!) most of the time, but say easy Hello's with other park-goers and dog lovers when paths meet. Marvin (my pup) and I strongly recommend checking out this peaceful gem!

Very peaceful place to go and walk among trees, flowering shrubs and plants.
Beautiful and free botanical garden. Especially lovely in the spring when the rhododendrons are out.

Amazing views. You feel like you are on the edge of the world.
A highly significant monument worth a visit. The start of Trans Canada Highway, running all the way to Newfoundland. Moreover, the start of Terry Fox cross-country run.

Parking is tough when theres a lot of people.
Had an awesome time walking around the area with my family. Before moving to the island, we traveled from Ontario and stopped at most of the monuments across Canada honoring Terry Fox and his courage to take on this journey.

If you're in the area during December evenings, the place is a marvel with wonderful light displays and music bringing the holiday cheer.
Went by to see the lights that were put up for Christmas, and was somewhat underwhelmed. While there are some gorgeous displays, I think the display could have been choreographed much better. There was no flow to these decorations. Next year they should higher an artist to plan it for them.
A place where the cold atmosphere of the end of the year is wrapped in warm light
It was great entertainment and many talented performance.
The one big irritant was the extreme loud music and annoying louder people behind the switch board who screamed on the top of their long, there were some young children who covered their ears as elderly people.
I hope the organizers and managements help so we can save our ear drums.
The lights were beautiful, the music was good. Food and drink venue was one that we lined up 30 minutes for hot chocolate, buy the time we got to order they where sold out. One Food vendor for an event you are expecting lots of people is a fail.

I see this as I‚Äôm sitting in my car at top parking lot admiring the expansive views.
Amazing unobstructed beautiful views of the Oceanside. The day was perfect and we enjoyed a little bite to eat while taking in the sights. The kids enjoyed climbing on the rocks and trying to get the best vantage point. Plenty of birds, boats and people all taking advantage of what the island has to offer. This was our first time here but definitely not our last as this seems like it could be a great area to view sunrises and sunsets so we want to check that out.
Fantastic viewing point. I wish we'd brought binoculars. The statue at the park was beautiful and had lots of hidden details.
It's an amazing overlook, not sure I would call it a park. The views are amazing.

Great spot to watch sunset! Lots of bluffs to explore, but it was incredibly windy.

The statue is huge and lying on the floor, but there is no sign that to explain why this statue lying down?

Truly breathtaking sunrise with the sun braking the land and mountains including Mount Baker to luminate the ocean. I have seen the sunset and sunrise from the top, they were both excellent. Fun place to have a nice walk. Would recommend waking up early for the sunrise but even if you don't, Mount Tolmie is a great place to have a calm walk around and look at the city.
A beautiful view with lots of hiking trails in every direction. A great place to have a walk in nature. Plenty of parking and a port a potty.
Walkable and drivable! Little mountain inside the urban city, so you get to see the 360 degree view of this amazing tourism city. 180 degree of ocean and 180 degree of mountain, nothing better than this!
Perfect place to view the sunsets, that being said, we were late to view it. It was cloudy but the sun was visible at points. It was our first time here, found it by fluke as we were leaving one destination for another and saw the sun break through the clouds and wanted a vantage point without all the trees that line the sides of the road. Seemed to be a popular place as it was somewhat filled in the upper and lower parking lots. Would definitely love to come back and relax and watch the sun cross the sky. Would recommend stopping in and take in the view of the city and the skyline..
Overlook the city. Either in a car or by foot. It's a great spot to let the scenery sink in. Life gets busy, don't let go of the little things. This is a little thing, soak it up even if you're a local. You never know when your clock is up.

Can be a bit hazardous, so only recommend if in good health and good footwear.
Best spot for sunsets in the whole South Island.
Nice little hike up some rocks and grass. The view is absolutely spectacular on a clear day, you can literally see for miles in all directions. Nobody else was there when went and we were treated to an extra awesome surprise. A huge eagle had decided to sit and chill on the to of the monument. A woman was watching us from the roadside wondering why we all had our phones and cameras out, when she noticed the massive bird. She ran  grabbed her camera from her house and came back only to scare him off...
Pretty nice place to go for the sunset. You can also see Mt Baker and the Olympics
Walbran Park is a great place; I smoked a lot of weed up there in my college days back in the early 90's!üòÜ It's a great place because it seems like not many people know about it, other than the people in the neighborhood; any time I go up there, I'm alone! Right now there are Scotch broom and Camas blooming; the yellow and purple give a real Easter feel! My favorite spot is a little park bench that you'll find if you walk up to the top where the stone pyramid is, then down the other side of the hill. There is a gnarly Arbutus tree right next to it, and a fantastic view! See if you can find it! I have a YouTube channel; in the next couple of weeks I'm going to post a video that will show you how to get to that park bench! Check out my channel and subscribe so you don't miss it!

11 a.m. - 5 p.m. No entrance fee, but donations encouraged. Parking on the street.

Volunteers greet you and answer questions in the garden.

Tea House in the former home. Lucked out for an opening for afternoon tea, but reservations encouraged. $55 per person. There is also a four course tea, elevenses, and a few extra add-ons available. The three course afternoon tea with a pot of tea of your choice is $54. Very tasty and beautifully presented.

Friendly service, lovely setting. Be warned there are lots of annoying wasps on the terrace that swarm the tea tray even with a napkin draped over the tiers. There is indoor seating available as well.

Restroom/washroom inside by hostess stand and next to the gift store.
Had tea and a walk in the garden. Tea was pleasant and tasty. Not the fancy high end atmosphere of other places in town but more choices than some places including elevenses selection. Garden has some interesting specimens and a couple of amazing huge peonies. You can buy some plants here as well.
We went here for my birthday to experience the high tea, I reserved ahead of time and we got a beautiful seat by the window with a view.

The food was delicious and the tea perfect! If you go to the tea house I highly recommend the Royal Abkhazi High Tea! It consists of 4 courses and the herbal tea I had was Angelwater.

The Gardens were stunning! With beautiful assortments of flowers and alot of history the volunteers told us so much about this beautiful place.

I highly recommend checking out this place, the food is amazing and the gardens (especially at this time of year) are beautiful and blooming.
Abkhazi is Vancouver Island's secret garden. It is an absolutely beautiful garden that boasts huge old rhododendrons that are artfully placed throughout. Granite outcroppings dictate the shape of the surrounding garden beds. It is the jewel of the island. An added bonus is the quaint tea shop that serves high tea in China cups. There's no entrance fee, but they appreciate donations.
Peaceful walk through a beautiful space! If you want to enjoy tea service you have to book ahead. Lovely gift shop featuring local Artisan treasures.

ChIJz9m76Op0j1QRZl1tXNXsoQU,Beacon Hill Children's Farm,4.7,48.4116201,-123.3634511,1458,"What a great place to bring the entire family! They had a good size petting zoo full of adult goats, a couple of pregnant goats and a couple of baby goats. They had brushes for people to brush the goats while petting. Plenty of kids enjoying themselves. Staff inside were knowledgeable and friendly. Outside the petting zoo it was neat to see the llamas, chickens, guinea pig, peacocks  and the other animals around. This is a family activity that does not cost an arm and a leg. Definitely worth the visit!
My 1.5 year old son and wife LOVED this place! We arrived to Victoria via cruise ship and had a day to explore. This farm was our first stop. It‚Äôs surrounded by a beautiful park and the animals were very social and seemed happy. Staff were around to keep an eye on families and pick up goat poop which was very much appreciated. There are wash stations in between animal areas and the farm was quite clean and well kept. Overall we had a blast and would recommend a pit stop here via pedicab to get the most scenic route!
Haven't been since before covid. The donation is no longer optional which is good to know if you're on a budget. Two adults and our 1 and year old was 14 dollars. Masks are optional through the park but mandatory if you want to pet/visit the goats.
Affordable Children's Farm experience, around $5 for kids and i think $7 for adult...

Highlights of our experience are the close up interactions with birds & petting the goat... The alpaca's area was a bit stinky in my opinion.. Probably because of our timing (May) there's not much animals to explore..

But nonetheless, the place is worthwhile and a great exposure for kids to know the real world of animal on a  farm setting..
I have a worst experience due to a racist staff in the goat petting area. As I went inside there is a baby goat came up to me seems like he needs a cuddle as I was about to pick him up the racist team member said you are not allowed to pick up the goat.
Later I saw him holding goats and giving it to people for cuddles and I saw other people too picking the goats themselves near him and he was ok.
But that racist man needs to learn that everyone is equal regardless of their age and color. You should learn some respect and don‚Äôt have double standards

A fun experience that included a suspension bridge, beach waterfall, tide pools, and unique rock formations. Toni is a fun knowledgeable guide who absolutely loves her job and the area. Lunch was great ‚Äì the gluten chicken sandwich was delicious. Highly recommend getting a baked good when lunch is picked up. Worth the time and effort ‚Äì would definitely go on a hike with Rainforest Tours again!
I had a wonderful time doing the East Sooke Regional Park - Aylard farm.  The views were breathtaking and well worth the time and money.  Toni was a great guide & hike compagnon!
Was lucky enough to do a full day tour with Toni in East Sooke park!

It was just 2 of us with Toni and she was amazing. Having recently recovered from injury, Toni was attentive to my needs and provided lots of breaks (filled with nature facts) and the best lunch spots! She was well prepared with lunch, ponchos and extra gear if needed! Being safety conscious I was very happy to see she had a full ‚Äútrip binder‚Äù of maps and evacuation points if anyone was injuries, as well as an extensive first aid kit! We were able to go to two different locations because we finished our loop early.

I really appreciate Toni‚Äôs flexible planning and extensive knowledge of the routes she leads you on. She truly knows the land and has watched it evolve through the years, and it‚Äôs fascinating to hear what has changed through the years. This is my first guided hike, and now that I‚Äôve seen how great a local guide is, I can not be going back! I will absolutely be doing more of Toni‚Äôs hikes the next time I‚Äôm in the area, and I can‚Äôt recommend her enough!
An awesome day in nature with Toni and Dan.  Simply excellent!
We did a full day hike at the Southern Juan de Fuca trails (Mystic Beach). It was great! Toni was a well-organized, nice, and insightful guide.

We could have rented a car and planned our own exploration of trails near Victoria. But booking the Rainforest Tour was a great decision. We didn't need a car for the rest of our trip, so it would be an unnecessary expense and hassle. It was also much nicer to have someone drive us! Plus, Toni knew the best places to stop for a break and snack en route and the best trails to see. The experience was made simpler and stress-free by booking the tour. All we had to do was arrive at the pick up spot (Tourist Information booth at the Harbour) and enjoy the day. A key feature for us was that it was a small group (max 6 people).

Mystic Beach was an enjoyable destination. The trail is a good balance between nature walk and hike. There are areas where you have to mind your footing, so it is best to wear good shoes or even hiking boots. I wore good walking shoes and was fine. If you are not an experienced hiker, it should be no problem; just take your time and you'll be fine. This is a great day trip for all skill levels.

There was a heat wave the week we did the tour. It was ok in the trails: the tree canopy and ocean breeze created a very comfortable experience.

Next time we are in Victoria we will book again to see the old growth forests in the Northern Juan de Fuca trails.

What a fun place to visit... we took a water taxi across the bay from Fisherman's Wharf to Chinatown it was a fun and different experience for only $12 a person. We had a cool  match on ice with almond milk. Right next to the Fan Alley.. it was yummy.
Note: a lot of items are listed in Canadian prices and our US $1.00 is equivalent to $1.20
The home of then Famous Fan tan alley(Narrowest alley) and First Chinatown in Canada. One of the nicest, cleanest and safest Chinatown‚Äôs in Canada. Super fun to visit both in the day time and night time when all the lights are shining. Overall a great place to visit. The Chinatown in Victoria, British Columbia is the oldest Chinatown in Canada and the second oldest in North America after San Francisco's.
Come on down and check out Canada‚Äôs oldest Chinatown. Browse through the many shops, or eat at one of the restaurants. The tea restaurant was one of my favorites. There is such a rich culture packed into a small area. You most definitely have to take a walk down Fan Tan Alley!

The place I met on my way to the Victoria West Community Center. A beautiful Gorge water way and a nice Selkirk Trestle bridge catches the eye.
Beautiful trails right by Gorge Waters with a well fenced and newer playground behind the YMCA building limited in parking but dog friendly.
This was my second attempt at strolling through this area. I came a few weeks ago but the park was locked off with police tape due to an officer being attacked. The area is super quiet and seems like a nice place to relax. There is a beautiful view of the water and it has a floating dock the you can swim out too as well. Great place for walking or riding a bike as it leads out to the Selkirk Trestle. I highly recommend coming and exploring this location, I'm sure the incident was a one off as this is a beautiful family oriented environment with a playground not too far off for more enjoyment for the kids.

You would also see a lot of cruise ships anchored near this breakwater.
Now this is a pretty walk. Enjoy the sunset or simply try and spot a seal. Perfect for viewing cruise ships. Great place to snap shots of the mountains and ocean.

They have some creative holes that require you to use your hands or paddles. We also did Ping Pong which was fun and just a great time for my son's birthday while we were in Victoria. Would definitely return when we come back again. Definitely recommend booking online for both golf and Ping Pong especially on a weekend!
It was really fun, and I loved the spooky theme!  This was more than just typical mini golf. Some holes require you to place your ball and move the table or use paddles or chains to lift the ball out. I only visit Victoria once every few years, but I would definitely come back to play this course again.  Also, they offered a delicious ice cream sandwich that was gluten and dairy free and so so good. We visited on a Monday at dinner time with no reservation and we didn't have to wait.
We had a fun time! We called ahead for a reservation but I think we could have walked in. They have food and drink available if you need something. The set and decorations for the different rooms were so cool and spooky. The lighting was  very dark and alternating bright and colorful, it was a little hard on my eyes but my son loved it. I thought it was a bit expensive but it really was fun and totally interesting. I think we could have easily finished in 20 ish minutes but we took our time to enjoy the sets and different holes.
The themeing on this place is top notch, you can tell that the designers really put their entire heart into their work. Multiple hiles of mini gold that take place outside and inside a haunted house. The rooms which contain all kinds of props, effects, and video screens, tell a progressing story of a family's descent into madness. Imagine a darker Disney Haunted Mansion... it really is that high quality. Then add that you play mini golf inside... Unusual to be fair but awesome in execution. Soak it all in. They also have   a ping pong loft in the back, lockers to store your stuff, food and beverages... it's a great way to spend an afternoon or evening. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED if you like haunted houses or mini golf or both.
Took my family (of 3) here on Saturday, fun atmosphere cool idea.

But very short could do the course in 10 mins if there's no one infront of you, couldn't see the ball or head of the putter and it's not glow in the dark and if it was not enough black lights to make it work

Still it was fun to try but honestly it cost for 2 adults and 1 child $72 imo not worth the price

Great park for everyone to enjoy! Easy walking trails, dog leash friendly, birdhouses, bat-houses, friendly people out and about. Cross the bridge and there's Meadow Park? I think that's the name. Lovely playground for the older children. The climbing equipment is rated 2.5. Yrs and up.

One of my favourite places to take friends when I show them Victoria. Parking isn‚Äôt a problem when you roll like this üòâ
This park is truly a hidden gem, hiding amongst the back streets of downtown Victoria, this dwarf mountain makes up for a spectacular view of the city, and our neighbouring country MURICA. There are no paths to the peak, making the journey difficult for the physically abled and only for the most extreme wheelchair enthusiasts.
Best kept secret. Grand views out to see and bracing on a windy day.
It was a bit hard to find the street entrance when following Google maps so we accidentally went up the wrong way and found ourselves in someone's yard. That was awkward. But the view is amazing and sitting up there watching the sunset was definitely a trip highlight. Plus, so many lovely kinds of moss to admire!

Super cool spot love it !
The Gate of Harmonious Interest marks the entryway to Canada's oldest Chinatown. Built in 1981 as an effort to preserve the Chinatown heritage. It was modelled after both the gateway of the Dunhuang Caves in China and the gate of Pingshan Hall in China. The roof is covered with golden glazed tiles, and decorated with Chinese supernatural creatures on the corner ridges. The two Chinese verses on the two front side-panels mean ""to work together with one mind"" and ""to help each other to achieve harmony.""
Great chinese architecture. Well maintenanced. Clean and bright.
Lots to see and do.

Great views from Harling point, and spots to stop and sit for some mindful moments as well. Typical BC beach area with stony sand and driftwood!
I came there at night, so I posted what my phone was able to capture: the sky. Cattle point is better for stargazing, but Harling Point works fine too (if you don't care too much about the Chinese Cemetery next to it).
It was really to walk on the rocks. In addition to the colorful chairs, look for the bench a bit further down, to the left. It's really amazing to see the waves crashing just a few meters in front of you
Really picturesque. The water was crystal clear, and the atmosphere was really unique
People around are quite friendly . Interesting legend of harpoon rock .And beautiful chairs to enjoy the view . Terrain has geographical importance .

An easy walk of about 5-10 minutes will take you to the light beacon and end of the breakwater. Has great views of the harbour and the ocean front. Sometimes when cruise ships are in port it can be very busy. On windy days you are quite exposed to the wind and possibly ocean spray.  Historically there were no fencing on the breakwater but now they have railings along the top on both sides. At a few points, you can go down stairs to access the lower breakwater. The lower break water can be difficult to walk on as it is just large rectangular stones that can be uneven. The lower breakwater is often where divers scuba dive and people fish.
An excellent vantage point to feel the ocean. Take a walk and explore wild life along the way. Killer whales, seals, sea lions, and so much more. A great place to chat and catch up with friends or showcase out of town guest the beauty of Victoria's shoreline. A jewel of Victoria not to miss.
Located on the waterfront with ocean and mountain views. Cycling and pedestrian trails follow the shoreline overlooking the Juan de Fuca Straight.
Holland Point to Ogden breakwater light ‚Ü©Ô∏è walk evening is a favorite with magnificent ever-changing sky, light, and season. We are blessed.

It‚Äôs a small, but great little spot. I expected it to be a bit larger, but our main goal was to see some of the totem poles British Columbia has to offer. These are absolutely gorgeous and huge. There are some large rocks you can climb up to get a beautiful view of Victoria and the ocean at the same time. Take 20 minutes out of your day and enjoy it.
Just a great place to spend time watching the water craft and waterfowl. Although the walkway could use a good cleaning of the goose droppings (at least once a week). Even in a minefield you have a chance of not stepping on a mine. nasty.
A shore hugging park along the waterfront of Victoria‚Äôs Inner Harbour, Songhees Point Park is a great place to watch the navigation of seaplanes, Coho Ferry, private yachts, sailing boats and Victoria Harbour Ferry boats.

The one and half hectare park encompasses the start of the Westsong Walkway, a three kilometer pathway to Esquimalt, at the Johnson Street Bridge. Trees and shrubs shade wonderful places to stop for breaks and to take a photo.

At low tides Discovery Rock might be accessible over the rock and mud seafloor. The Delta Victoria Ocean Point Hotel borders the parkland and has many beautiful flower displays. Tuzo Rock is just off shore. And a lovely small sandy beach can be found on the east side of Songhees Point at low tides. Include a stroll up the rocks that form Songhees Point, there is evidences of glacial activity on these granite rocks as well as an unique outdoor art.  There are several benches and grassy points along the four hundred meters of paved and concrete footpaths. This is a wonderful park to explore in your neighborhood.

A fantastically historical spot. Beautiful and a great spot to admire the beautiful area. If you've never been under this bridge, do yourself a favor and visit. Read the signs, they have a great story to tell.
Beautiful spot for a break, or for a walk. The Tillicum Narrows, known as the Canal of Camosack back in the 1800‚Äôs is located on the Gorge Waterway in Victoria, BC, Canada. Reversing rapids are caused by the narrow pinch point at Tillicum Narrows where a large amount of tidal water is forced through the narrow passage. Currents have been known to reach up to 9 knots (17km/h) here. The tides caused by the moon make massive amounts of water move up and down the gorge and this unique feature makes for white water rapids, waterfalls or a surging channel depending on the water height. A bridge was built here due to the narrow crossing. The current bridge is the seventh incarnation.
Picture was taken when the tide was receding down to .29m. The roar of the water was louder than the traffic above on the bridge.
Interesting spot, especially the views of the bridge and the water flow.

Andy was friendly, entertaining and very knowledgeable. You can tell he's incredibly passionate about his city & was excited to share as much info as possible with us in the 2 hours. He told us some great stories about the city, the buildings/streets, and the people.

The food on the tour was delicious, plentiful and perfectly ordered between savory & sweet. Even Andy's intro of the food and the background on the restaurant/owners was so interesting to hear. My partner had the regular tasting & I asked for vegetarian -- I've never had such a great vegetarian experience on a food tour before (in fact, I expected not to be catered for as well, which has generally been the case on my previous food tours, so I ate breakfast right before -- big mistake as I ate a LOT of great food on this tour!).

Andy didn't ask for tips at the end, but we do know it's customary to tip in North America. We didn't have any cash and we assumed there would be an electronic method to tip, but there wasn't, and we've never felt so bad because of just how good Andy & the tour was. We'd highly recommend this tour for both tourists and locals. Thanks for a great day Andy!
Andy‚Äôs a great tour host and a really awesome guy. He makes it feel like you were just walking thru Victoria with a fun, long time friend. He pays attention to the little details and ensures support of local businesses. Highly recommend.
I've been to quite a few walking tours, but this one has them all beat! Andy was phenomenal! Not only was he a great time keeper, but he is incredibly knowledgeable about the city of Victoria.  The spots he selected for the food samples were all excellent choices. I came out of it super full and well-versed about the city of Victoria's history. Highly recommend!
Four of us did this tour, all living locally in Victoria. It was fantastic! Andy is charismatic and very knowledgeable both in food and facts. Highly recommend this experience whether you're visiting from afar or looking to explore in your own backyard.
An absolutely fantastic food and history experience. Good mix of savory and sweet foods. Dietary restriction friendly. Andy was phenomenal. The walking was great. As long as you can walk 5 blocks at a time (at most) and manage a few stairs at a time, this is the tour for you.

This park changes with the seasons and offers both grand vistas and an opportunity to see beautiful wild flora. Easy walking paths wander through glades of Garry Oak and rock out-cropping. A small play ground, makes this a perfect park to take the family out to experience some Victorian nature and to gain some perspective. There is something magical about the place.
Beautiful place to walk. Especially in spring when it's full of wild flowers. Nice little park for the kids and the reservoir is cool too check out.

Built: 1885
To: Charles & Matilda Thomson

ARCHITECTURE:
2 storey Italian
Known for many years as the Dingle House Restaurant, it was attributed to John Teague, although there is no evidence that he was the architect. It was built for Charles William and Matilda Ringler Thomson, who lived in it until their death in 1916. Charles, or ‚ÄúGasworks Thomson‚Äù as he was affectionately called, was born in London, England, in 1827. He left in 1859 for the Gold Rush in California, ended up on Vancouver Island and became a mule trader, supplying pack animals in the Cariboo. In 1860, Charles married Matilda Midwinter in San Francisco. Matilda was born in Kent, England, in 1823. The couple came to Victoria and Charles became secretary and eventually manager of the newly formed Victoria Gas Co (502 Pembroke St., Burnside). He also had other interests, including real estate and finance, becoming a partner in BC Loan Co. Charles and Matilda succumbed to bronchitis during the bitterly cold winter of 1916. The $1 million estate went to Charles' sister, Janet Ringler Thomson, who left the house empty for nearly two years.

Willows Beach is ideal for enjoying summer activities such as beach volleyball and skimboarding, due to its sand beaches and shallow waters great spot for family gatherings and outdoor barbecues.
Popular staple beach in the neighbourhood.  Parking lot by the park on Beach or along esplanade.  Long beach with logs for sitting and playing.  Surprisingly the water has lots of nice sand if you walk out a bit in some areas.  Playground and grassy area for picnics with the rotary tea house in summer time.  Oak Bay Tea party is held here in June which is good for a visit.  When looking at the water on the far left is Cattle point so good walk up there.

Only problem is, there is an insane amount of rocks in the water. I bled a little when it cut my foot.. so i would be careful where you step. Otherwise, the water isn't too deep, not too cold either.

There are wide pathways for pedestrians, and marked cycling paths as well that are newly installed.

The pond by this beach is nice, but often infested with geese droppings, and such becomes a bit inaccessible.

Sadly, I needed another size and the associate named Mansi helped me return and place the new order right away and arranged for free shipping. As I had paid my initial order using a gift card, I was not sure how return would work out but she was super supportive and managed the process so well. Great service even with so much rush at the peak hour.
The jeans i was looking for (and it said were in stock online at this location) only had size 00 & 20 - basic black skinny jean. Not one of the staff offered help, walked past me a few times.

Previously, I brought my teen son in, and no one helped us on the floor or at the change rooms with sizes - or asked how my son was doing in the change room. I emailed the store & never heard back.
I shop here because I have to, its one of the few places anyone over the size of 14 can shop. The prices are incredibly expensive for the fast fashion they area, and you are at a whim to whats in style. I wish they sold more basics that didn't come pre-ripped.
Thanks justine for a good quick talk!
Ive been shopping at old navy and i notice that justine has a lot of hairstyle. I love this store, they got the best and unique staff. AND sale!
Awesome store! Starts with a warm welcome at the door and the specials/deals. Cashier was friendly and patient as I looked for my coupons and credit card in my huge purse and a long line behind me. Every employee here I've come across was courteous and helpful.

ChIJPb5aIJ1zj1QRzo_A1LmhrqA,Reitmans,3.6,48.4470527,-123.3692517,51,"Bad customer service. The store manager was very rude and didn't appreciate us browsing for clothes. Kept asking us to collect the hangers after we tried on clothes. You have store associates to help sort clothes, don't expect customers to go picking up hangers. She needs basic training on talking to customers. It was on a Monday at 3pm.
I will start off by saying, I get crazy anxiety when I have to go pants shopping-I avoid it at all costs unless I absolutely need to. It was one of those times yesterday and I was dreading a trip to the mall. I had gone into several stores and none of them had quite what I was looking for, and I was starting to get overwhelmed. I‚Äôve gotten nice professional pants from Reitmans before so I decided to stop in as my last effort before I gave up. They had exactly what I was looking for! Best of all, there wasn‚Äôt a crazy hassle to get into the change rooms, the staff were super friendly and easygoing. Often times when shopping in retail stores I feel like an inconvenience to the workers but this was not the case at all here! I even worked up the courage to ask them if they had the pair I was buying in a different colour in my size, and while they didn‚Äôt have it in store they offered to order me a pair and have it shipped right to me!! I left feeling more than happy with my shopping trip. Thank you to the lovely staff who helped me have such a comfortable experience :)
I wear Plus Size clothing - a size range that is becoming harder and harder to find as stores close out and change their clothing focus to smaller sizes. I was trying to find a top to wear to my mother's Celebration of Life in 3 days. I did a quick round of the store and picked a half dozen different possibilities that I needed to try on. I don't buy clothing on-line as finding the right fit is very challenging and I don't buy anything without trying it on first. I was heading towards the fitting rooms only to be told in a snippy manner that the Fitting Rooms were closed as it was nearing the end of the day and they needed to be cleaned. It was 25 minutes before the closing time. There was one other customer in the store. Ummm....in a time where brick and mortar stores are shutting down because of lack of sales in person and people shifting to on-line purchases, this is pathetic customer service. Reitmans was once a great place to shop for Plus Size clothing but the experience that I've had at this location means I will never step foot in this store again!
I had poor customer service this evening when trying to return an item. The woman was very condescending to my request when a little empathy would have gone a long way. I understand there are policies and procedures, but you don't need to be rude about it.
I walked into this store today (Monday). It was quiet. There were 3 associates talking to each other.  None of them were greeting any of the customers including myself, that were walking into the store. I Stayed in the store, for at least 30 minutes. One of the Associates came  beside me to sort out the racks. She still did‚Äôt acknowledge my presence as a customer.

Then, I when went to one of the Associates  to check out the price of all of the items.  She was not very friendly at all.

The salesperson #888888 who processed my items was friendly but still, this store needs to train their associates to be more Customer focused.

There seemed to be plenty of size small and medium items in stock but few items size large and no sizes above a large. In this day and age, I would expect shops and brands to be more size-inclusive.
Love this store so much. It was my first time going into this store today, but they have great quality clothes,  affordable pricing and what‚Äôs  more, super nice and helpful staffs! Although it was extremely busy there while I was trying, staffs are really helpful to give me advise about the style and the size. I was not sure which size to try so I got  lots items in wrong sizes, but the staff checked in with me while I was in fitting room, and got all correct sizes for me immediately. I am so impressed by their customer service. Sometimes I feel some boutiques are kinda pushy or not helpful at all, but at this store, I felt staffs are truly kind and helpful. I definitely recommend this store.
The clothes here are beautiful, good quality and fairly priced. The main reason for the glowing review is the costumer service, the manager went above and beyond for me after I found an issue with one piece I bought. Definitely turned me into a repeat customer.
I love their selection, the styles were all me!  Sometimes difficult to find a particular size because they don‚Äôt overbuy.  Staff was very helpful and attentive.
I shopped at Spank on Saturday to find a dress to wear to an upcoming wedding. Although the store had many options, I left before I had tried them all on due to the rude, fat-shaming nature of the employee working the change room. When my mother commented that she didn't like one of the dresses I tried on, the change room employee agreed saying ""I was going to say, you look a bit heavy...""  Afterwards, I was trying on a dress and the employee insisted I try it in another colour. Through the door I could hear her calling to her coworker across the store to find the other dress saying repeatedly ""No, she needs a size large. A large! She needs a large!!""  She had not asked me what size I needed, just assumed, and I had to correct her through the door, saying ""No I am a medium."" These comments made me uncomfortable and self-conscious. Even if she didn't have ill-intent I think it is undeniable that this behaviour is inexcusable and unacceptable, especially by a complete stranger when someone is in the vulnerable state of trying on clothes (I did not ask for her opinion in the first place lol). I am not an overweight person and I am finally confident and happy with my body after years of struggle, yet this employee made me feel extremely insecure by her use of the word 'heavy', assumptions about what size I wear and the shouting of that size across the store. I worry about how someone who is plus-size or struggling with body image issues or an eating disorder would feel after an encounter with this employee. So disappointing.

Before she could try them on (she's in a wheelchair) she ended up in hospital. Post going home I became ill and couldn't go to see her to assist with trying on clothing. I called the store just before 30 day refund notice was due *as I wouldn't be able to make the deadline. The clerk said no problem - they would work it out if it was only a few days. I went in 8 days late and was told no refund at all. Just store credit. There was zero compassion or empathy. just kept my money and issued me a gift card for the amount - over $200. My mom can't shop there as their clothing doesn't work for her - except for 2 pairs of pull up pants.
I will not be recommending Penningtons to anyone. The service was cold and uncaring.
Went in to return an online purchase only to realize i had received the wrong packing slip and had no form of receipt on hand. The staff was friendly and super helpful focused on finding a solution to save me another trip to the store. Excellent customer service and will shop there again based on my first impression/experience with them!!
I give the Victoria Pennington's location a full 5 stars for their consistent, excellent customer service.  I've shopped here for many years, and the ladies who work here are always friendly and very helpful. My visit yesterday was no exception... top-notch service!
Clothing selection and quality can be a bit hit-or-miss, but I've been pleased with most of my purchases.
The last time I was here, the salesgirl embarrassed me. She did help me, as I was having trouble finding certain things in my size, but at the cash register she loudly asked what size I had chosen to get. I was embarrassed because there were strangers in earshot and I was buying highly personal things.

You'd think someone working in a plus-size store would realize that sizes would be a touchy subject. She could have just asked, ""Did you find what you needed?"" That would have been more discreet.
Placed an order and and put in my address wrong as it was my auto correct called right away to fix the address and was told sorry there is a zero cancellation policy or cannot fix my address. I said I don‚Äôt want to cancel I just need my address fixed so my parcel doesn‚Äôt go to the wrong address and the customer service lady said sorry there is nothing I can do. So needless to say my parcel is going to go to the wrong address and I now have to wait for it to hopefully be returned and who knows how long that will take. So if you‚Äôre gonna order I wouldn‚Äôt do it online as this was my first time ordering online.

I go to Mango's 2 or 3 times a year when in town and have been for many years now.  Nicole is great and very good at suggesting product that would suit my style.  I would highly suggest checking them out.  Their selection is top notch.  You won't be disappointed!
Unfortunate experience here, especially visiting Victoria. The store caught our eye immediately and my wife and I were excited to check it out. We were followed around by an employee who cleaned up or adjusted EVERYTHING we looked at. It was extremely uncomfortable and so we obviously left not buying anything. The good news‚Ä¶ I got to confirm the colour of Cele hat I wanted to buy before purchasing elsewhere.

Interesting follow up to my review from the owner. I am socked and stunned by it. Clearly they have my wife and I confused with someone else.

I‚Äôm not here to get into an argument about what you think is the correct way to treat customers. I just simply wanted to share my experience in hopes that other might not have my experience. What‚Äôs even worse now about all this is to say that someone‚Äôs personal experience isn‚Äôt valid is a very unfortunate way to conduct yourself.

The clothes here have that ""je ne sais quoi"" that makes them so much more interesting than any of the clothing you'd find in a standard brand name store. It could be a unique hemline, interesting collar, or gorgeous textile. The owner also has some of her own designs. But even better than the clothes is the service! I spent about an hour in the store with the owner who encouraged me to try things that I wouldn't have been able to put together myself and created a fabulous outfit! She has a great eye. She's also honest and fun to work with. Also, you'll never see anyone else with the same item because she only orders a few then when it's gone it's gone. I highly recommend this boutique.
During a recent visit to the city, I bought a beautiful mockneck sweater that caught my eye in the window while walking by. The owner is so friendly and she stocks a gorgeous variety of pieces. A Greek designer that I would have never heard of otherwise made the top I bought. Lovely quality. Worth going into the store in person to check it out if you live in the city or are visiting!
I love this store! Right up front I'll warn you though...there are not alot of sizes in the styles here so if you are over a size 12 I'm afraid this isn't the store for you. The lovely owner, who is always i the shop, is an extremely accomplished tailor/seamstress and you will see examples of her own creations around the store. She buys excellent quality, stylish but comfortable clothing in cottons, linens and good wools and you really have to look carefully because of you do, you'll find some incredible prices on clothes I've seen at Hughes (just about the most expensive women's store in  Victoria). The other beauty of this shop is that youre not going to see other people wearing the same thing because she may have only one or two of something. The brands change with the seasons but I bet most women will walk in here and find something to love. The owner is also honest about what will look good on you and pay attention because she will make you look pretty fabulous if you listen to her suggestions. She slso is generous in giving discounts at the end of the season so even if there is no ""sale"" sign in the window if it's February and she still has alot of stock left then she'll offer a generous discount if you like something. She's been in this odd location, in the mall right next to the entrance to the Conference Centre (and near Liberty coffee) for ten years and I think that shows she knows what shes doing because you could easily walk by the shop and miss it.

Cannot tell you how many compliments I have received and people asking where I get my clothes from. They also carry beautiful pottery and jewelry from local artists. The staff is wonderful, caring, and very helpful! They are always wearing Smoking Lily pieces so it's easy to get inspiration for outfits. I'm seeing some other reviews about their clothes being pricey... but you're paying for high quality fabric (amazingly soft cotton, stretchy linen, etc.), beautiful prints, and the uniqueness of their pieces.
If you're visiting Victoria this store is a must for one of a kind finds. If you're a local, this is the place for zero waste, comfortable, flattering clothing and accessories. Locally made from start to finish, and such beautiful designs and prints. Don't miss it!
Great service and I love that the clothes are made locally. They use high quality fabrics that are so comfortable!
Adore this shop. Screen printed tees have great whimsical designs. You'll get plenty of compliments from people when you wear something from this shop.

My absolute favourite place to shop! So many unique awesome pieces.
Dots is really unique, everything is inexpensive and some things are amazing quality. Tbh the prices are cheaper than value village but everything is new. I come here a lot with my partner and they find some amazing fits. Highly recommend if you want to look good on a budget. The men's selection is small but quality for business casual stuff.

The clothes are well made and yes, a bit pricey, but when it comes to business clothes, you get what you pay for.  All of the staff were absolutely brilliant, but Victoria went out of her way to make my experience (and my friend's) feel comfortable, beautiful, and heard - no matter your size.  Excellent all around and I will definitely be back!
Me and my friend visited the Laura uptown yesterday,  we were searching for something really particular,  Samin helped us to find the perfect outfit for me and my friend. She was really professional,  friendly and kind. She always had her beautiful smile in her face eventhough we giving her so many questions.  Thank you so much Samin for all your help and advice.  And really appreciate LAURA CANADA for there amazing employees üëè
The staff are super friendly and were very helpful in finding me a prom dress that would suit my body type!
Thanks again!
I went in to try a dress in the Uptown mall which I saw online for 222 on sale. The staff said she would order it to the store for me no need to order online.

2 weeks later I get a call ""Sorry this dress is now sold out."" I should have just ordered online from the start and not have taken her advice. Just unbelievable. I needed the outfit for a xmas party.
I love the flexibility of booking a private shopping appointment. I did this in September and with Shannon's expertise and knowledge I was able to put together my Fall wardrobe without any stress. Shannon made the whole experience FUN!! I get so many compliments when I wear the clothes she picked for me. I highly recommend you book an appointment!
A month later I went back for my winter coat and again Shannon helped me out. From now on I'm just going to let her pick all my clothes....LOL!!

very friendly staff.  I love the bamboo fabric!  They are the only store I have ever seen with bamboo prints!  I always find lots of dresses & tops when I go in or when I order on-line!
Lovely selection. Beautiful and comfortable clothing. Staff were so gracious and professional
Thank you to Blue Sky for such a positive experience. When the sale item I ordered online could not be shipped as stock had run out, I received a telephone call offering to substitute a similar sale item, more expensive, at the same price. That item was then shipped immediately. A very positive customer experience.
The ladies in the shop always take great care of you and the store generally has an uplifting atmosphere.  I was recently in to exchange some items and even though they weren't making much money from me i felt valued as a customer. I appreciate that! Their clothes really look great on my curvy figure and so comfortable. Best tights ever!

ChIJn8pu-qFzj1QRv0AWpu_cLWs,Suzy Shier,3.8,48.455071,-123.37628,35,"The store itself is fine but agree with previous reviews about the customer service. Knocking extremely loudly on me in the fitting room (without saying a single word) so much that you startle me just to ""check if someone is there"", is not only unprofessional but completely senseless. You could have just asked, gently knocked and followed it by a question, or looked at the bottom of the door to check if the room is occupied (the doors do not reach till the floor and you could easily see people's feet). Even the customer in the room next to me was scared from how aggressive it was. I also agree with the previous comments, there was at least 4 staff working and no one checked in at all (despite there being only a couple other customers).
More than 50% of their lights were off. Adjacent stores no issue with lights. When I asked staff why more than 50% of their lights were off, they offered no explanation. It was dark, difficult to the see fashions and a very poor shopping experience. Why bother to have the doors open. Turn off all the lights
and you can save even more money on electricity and staff with customers.
Awesome customer services..As i love to do window shopping so whenever I go to uptown I usually go in suzy too‚Ä¶They generally have various varieties of different outfits‚Ä¶however,there is a person named Snehjeet, She always have a smile on her face and help in finding the best suitable clothes for me.

This is the sweetest little shop ever. Infact, I spent my entire shopping morning here with my newborn and have never been so warmly welcomed in all my shopping experiences ( and I shop a lot) Margo is a an ANGEL! She was so so so patient while I ran back and forth to baby.. there‚Äôs so many cute things you could look and sniff for hours! I would have stayed the whole day with Margo, she was the best part about Amelia Lee !!!!
The over $200 purse I JUST bought from this store broke. It‚Äôs a large purse, I assumed it was strong enough to carry an iPhone, an iPhone charged me and small wallet and a key fob but I was wrong. The strap tore right off, my belongings went flying and now my phone is cracked and I can‚Äôt see the screen. I was told this bag was of good quality by the sales associate, she even said it was durable. I‚Äôm now out $200 and a less then a year old iPhone. Thanks !
I don‚Äôt really understand this store. I mean I get what they are going for, love the concept of combining fashion, lifestyle and motherhood. They have a bit of everything but not enough of anything which would make me want to stop by to search for something. Honestly, local supplies are great I‚Äôm all for shopping local/ but every store within and in the proximity of the downtown core carries the exact same stuff, hires the same people to collaborates on something ‚Äúunique‚Äù, differentiates themselves by the little oddities they sell which actually are also sold down the street, located in funky heritage buildings, which really are in not in areas easily accessible for moms or children, probably not in well cared for buildings, do not cater to tourists whatsoever despite being in the tourist hub, and are all in all crummy areas in the city, try something new! Of the non local brands carried- plenty and evey store probably on lojo carry them too. A piece or two atleast. There‚Äôs a reason this city is known as the place where fashion doesn‚Äôt exist.
I was surprised to see the boutique had relocated from Johnson St but this new location is excellent. I found a lovely sweater and blouse that are excellent wardrobe staples.

There were about 4 to 5 people on staff working yet no one greeted me, helped me, checked in on me on the change room, Etc. It was one of the most unprofessional settings I've ever seen, I do not understand how you can help customers by cranking the music and ignoring them. It's not a hard job to treat your customers with respect so they'll buy your items. I tried on several items and was going to make a purchase but due to my experience I did not and I will never return to this location again.
Was there today to buy a few things. Service was TERRIBLE. Was not greeted, went to the fitting room and she looked miserable, also didn‚Äôt greet me, finally comes over takes my items without speaking to me, I try to say hi how‚Äôs your day, she looks at me ‚Äúname‚Äù lol I‚Äôm like sonya please.. continued not to check on me.

Fell in love with the Kendall pants but they ran out of my size. Lucy the assistant manager was so kind to help me order a pair offline üòä

Good prices but the place is a mess.
Change rooms could use a clean.    Floors are filthy.   Hesitaded in taking my shoes off to try on clothing.

ChIJg9Frspp0j1QRe_6Tvr6c7w8,Urban Planet,3.3,48.4249452,-123.3657121,153,"WORST. Customer service. EVER. On more than one occasion I have stood in line on my lunch break to purchase things and have ended up leaving because the amount of time it takes them to serve one person is INSANE. I have never seen lazier or slower moving employees in my life. Today, after I finally got up to the counter, got acknowledged by the employee as wanting to pay, then he turned around and him and the other 3 employees stood leaning on the counter watching a security guard follow a shoplifter for a while, until I had to interrupt and politely ask if I could pay for my items so I can get back to work. If that was the first time it‚Äôs be one thing, but it‚Äôs like this every time unfortunately and quite frankly, it‚Äôs very disrespectful of other peoples time. Will not be back, you shouldn‚Äôt have to beg employees to let you purchase something in a clothing store.
They have a very poor return policy. They won't provide a refund on anything, and for a large number of items they won't even give an in-store credit. Apparently this is written in small print on your receipt, which they hand you AFTER you have already made your purchase. Don't ever purchase anything from here unless you are absolutely, 100% certain that it is the right size, shape, colour, style, etc, of something that you are sure you want, because you will likely be stuck with it afterwards whether you change your mind or not. Or better yet, save yourself the worry and just go someplace else.
I went into the store wanting to trade in a piece that i got in a size too small. I didn‚Äôt receive a receipt upon my purchase because they had ran out of paper. I later came in trying to trade in this piece for a larger size and the manager asked me for information which is reasonable. I had to show proof of my purchase through a bank statement which takes a while but she had rushed me and told me she was unwilling to look through purchases that I thought were the specific one. It was a lot unnecessary attitude that would‚Äôve all been avoided if the change rooms were being run and I didn‚Äôt have to wait a while to not even try on the clothing.
My experience if I could give it 0 I would, the staff was no where to be found the whole time I was there. The store was not clean either. When I was checking out the lady in the photo was being extremely mean to the girl she was training. Was also being extremely rude to me and my friends when we were confused about something. I had, had enough so I told her she didn‚Äôt need to be so rude she laughed at me. I told the girl in training that she was super nice and was doing an amazing job and to have a nice day. As I was leaving the lady in the photo called me a ‚Äústupid c*nt‚Äù I had turned back and said that was not appropriate in a work place and I asked for her name and she wouldn‚Äôt give it to me so I took this photo she called me a bunch of other names I really don‚Äôt think that is appropriate for a work place I will not be coming back horrible experience I felt attacked
Megan was extremely helpful during our visit today. We were trying to return an item from Urban Behaviour, and although she originally said we could not, she still wanted to confirm with her manager. He said we couldn‚Äôt, so she proceeded to assist us in finding other locations where we could make the return.

In the meantime, her manager called back after speaking to the district manager, and informed her she could in fact accept our return and give store credit.

Overall, she was helpful, patient, and a good customer service representative.

She noticed that I was shopping by myself, and she helped me with various sizes when I was in the trial room. Once she noticed that I was going for brown tones, a shade bit darker than my brown skin, she brought a lot of brown shades and designs out of her own accord (tops and bottoms) to see if I liked them & to experiment in the trail room! Really enjoyed my shopping experience with her.  I really respect her professionalism and really appreciate her kindness.
I went into this store browsing dresses for a somewhat last minute upcoming event, the staff greeted me with smiles and noticed I seemed defeated after a long search for dresses. They put their utmost effort in searching through the whole store and online for something that may work for my body type. Though I didn't find something at this location, they were all able to guide me to another store where I did! Thank you so so much! Your help made the search much easier!

Huge thank you to Joanne with an E. Back in March you helped me dress my bestie who was visiting. My Jo-Ann has an hourglass figure. Vavavavoom! Joanne found the perfect dress !

My friend and I were at the Mayfair Mall location in Victoria and she found a pair of pants. The sales lady sold her the pants but my friend realized that she had purchased the wrong size. The sales lady said that for inventory purposes they would have to do a return and then she could rebuy the pants. After a very painful process of doing the return, and my friend angry at how inconvenienced she was at having to wait for them to process this decided to just stick with the return of the pants. Glad you fixed your inventory situation but you lost a sale! We will not be back.

I did wanna comment on the return.policy cause so many people are upset about it. first, exchange or store credit is standard at Most places. and 2nd,what do you expect when.you shop somewhere that's cheaper than ur local thrift shop?? these girls bust there balls with the amount of stock they get constantly.  so if ur looking for great customer service, maybe try someplace more upscale.
Greeted nicely every time I come in, clean organized store. Staff go above and beyond to see if they have a size I need if they don‚Äôt they show me similar styles, very helpful and kind.
Great prices for nice styles.
However customer service is lacking... people who work there don't engage with the customers... very robotic, only saying the sales and what is mandatory to say.
I'm completely disappointed in the customer service here today, usually I love this place and bringing my friends there and reccomending this as a one stop shop but after today I will no longer.

I don't reccomend coming here unless you are okay with final sales even if clothings damaged by staff and you don't mind constantly not being told anything is a final sale/exchange only. You won't know until it's too late so unfortunate that I now can't come here anymore without feeling uncomfortable :/
If I would have known I could write a review for this store earlier I would have.

I bought two items and realized I actually didn‚Äôt need the second pair of shorts because I already had them! I went to return them two seconds after buying them. The ‚Äúmanager‚Äù laughed in my face and told me she doesn‚Äôt do returns and that there‚Äôs nothing she could do. I told her she just did my purchase? I didn‚Äôt even walk out of the store yet. Her other employee called me a ‚Äúsilly white girl‚Äù and I was asked to leave and smirked at because I‚Äôm bothering them and harassing them.

I won‚Äôt shop here and I love sirens. I‚Äôve never been treated so poorly in any retail store. Quite confusing to why I was being treated so poorly?

I went in wanting some help finding an outfit for an event but left because not one person greeted me or asked me if I needed anything, I walked around browsing for quite awhile too. Lost a sale because you ignored me.
I've been to this location several times and always have a great experience! I've bought items from here a couple times and the staff have always been really helpful and friendly. The times I was just browsing the store the staff were great too. I knew they were there to help but not hovering, which is perfect. The store is always clean and they have great selection...such cute clothes! Wish I could buy everything in the store!!
Hit and miss with the Staff. I am a fairly regular customer and tonights service was below average. I had some of my items brought to the front desk while I continued to shop and when I went to pay for everything  she forgot to add them, I kindly reminded her that she forgot those items. I thought she ran all the items through, as there were only two items, a dress and a belt to match the dress. She didn't put the belt with the rest of the order, although it was clearly indicated both items were to be added to the order. Cashier: Sofi and/or Associate: Taylor M, not sure which one but I have seen her there a few times while I shop and who ever it was had a horribly snobby attitude while she was ringing everything through. There is no reason for the horrible service I received from that one employee. As a store that sells fairly nice and pricey clothing the attitude of your employees should match exactly that! Thanks, I will make an extra trip to get the belt and it should not have been missed in the order the first or second time, seems like intentionally rude behavior. I hope the owner of the store takes better care of their employees so this doesn't have to happen to any customer, especially a regular....shameful!  At least the new girl was amazingly nice and helpful, along with the other lady helping me with dress sizes. Sometimes it's really great service, but the end of that shopping experience left a bad impression on customer service and satisfaction.
Their selection has improved dramatically (for the better) over the last few years. It's an odd mix of brands carried rhough, you have $300+ quality denim brands and then poorly made $50+ sweaters that the store has carried forever for reasons I don't understand. The staff at this location make sure your never standing around with items your going to be trying on, if you have any questions they will most likely make it to you and ask if you need anything before you even realize you do.. that being said, (and not all of them) but quite a few of the girls are not exactly very polite, in fact some of them can be quite bluntly judgemental and give off a very unwelcoming and entitled (not sure to what) aura. It resulted in me associating the whole store with these negative interactions I experienced and have witnessed others experience as well,  It would be a much more satisfying experience if the employees who give off this impression be reminded that as employees they are meant to represent the company  and the brand's it carries, be that negative or positive it does reflect back onto the store.
The customer service is questionable at the uptown location. The staff wasn't helpful and when I asked about professional wear. She pointed to a region and said you can find them in that region but all I saw were jeans and casual clothing. I guess maybe it's not the place for professional wear. But the staff, she could have told me sorry, we don't sell anything like that. Her attitude was surprisingly ignorant. I will never go in there again and I definitely prefer Zara more.

I rediscovered Verve last year and I couldn't be happier!  Since that time, I have loaded up on high quality cashmere sweaters, Louboutin boots, outfits for special events as well as cool jeans and jackets for day to day; all at 1/3 or less their retail value!!

Margot is phenomenal and her lovely shop carries a wide selection of well curated and highly stylish pieces. I thoroughly enjoy following her shop on Instagram (particularly Saturday‚Äôs when she posts entertaining videos with Monty the dog). I am always inspired by the fashion forward outfits she puts together.
Verve Fashion is a beautiful luxury designer consignment store with a great selection of clothing and accessories. I was greeted by Monty the dog and Margot was super lovely and kind. I left with a beautiful blouse and Monty made sure he said goodbye when I left. I will be returning :)
Once you meet Margot, the owner of Verve, you will never want to shop anywhere else again!  She is your very own personal shopper and she knows her brands and has amazing style!  Her store is filled with everything from shoes and handbags to clothes and jewelry.  She has fantastic High-low brands and there is something for everyone - even great menswear.   Once you shop at Verve, you will find it hard to pay retail prices anywhere else!

I don‚Äôt usually take the time to write reviews but I stopped in here quickly yesterday to buy my daughter some jeans.

The associate was balancing phone calls and other customers but never once did I feel I was an inconvenience. Not only was I assisted in getting the perfect pair of jeans but the one on one service I received was great. I will definitely stop in with my family next time we are on Vancouver island.
Would put 0 stars if I was able too, worse customer service ever ! 2 of them just sat around till. Didn‚Äôt bother to greet or ask if we needed help.  One girl was just eating a donut on the floor with other customers in store.

Thank you for providing my mom, sister and I with a very pleasant shopping experience.  You helped me find both pants and tops that suited my personality and body type.  I was very pleased. This is what shopping should always be like.  Friendly, stress free and fun.  It was extra fun that you had your 50% sale on when we were in your lovely store, now almost two weeks ago. Again, thank you!
I've heard a lot about this new store from my friends and decided to give it a try. I have been to other mid to high-end boutiques in Europe and, to be honest, I didn't expect to see anything even close to those European stores that I visited. To my huge surprise, this store impressed as soon as I stepped in. Very bright and stylish and at the same time inviting and comfy. You can see the store owners put a lot of work and love in this place.

In addition to the store design, I was taken back with the clothes selection and how it's tastefully organized on the rack and the shelves. Kudos to Natalie and Maria!

And what a service! These girls treated me as VIP and for this short period of time I was given some beautiful choices for outfits and also the style that would suite me the best.
It's definitely not your ordinary store. I'll be back for more shopping!
I had a fantastic experience here. The lady at the shop was so warm and helpful; she picked out some great options that I wouldn‚Äôt have picked myself. Vast selection of very high quality clothing from Europe.
Outstanding women's fashion shop. Great selection, excellent quality and terrific service. Not the cheapest stuff, but worth the cost. Shame the Langley store has closed. :(
Love the quality of the clothes and also the warmest services and great advices from the kind lady who works there. I go there all the time now.

A new favourite! The owner Lindsey, is kind, friendly, and funny. You can tell she loves what she does. She has an amazing selection of gorgeous and unique clothes and accessories. A real pleasure to shop here.
Amazing selection of unique beautiful clothes that you won‚Äôt find anywhere else. Pants that actually fit my body and look flattering! That‚Äôs a first. A must visit. Super friendly warm service.
I had the pleasure of visiting this sweet little shop when I was in town on vacation a few weeks ago and I LOVED IT! The shop owner was very warm and friendly and you could tell that this store was a passion project for her. We shared quite a few laughs together as I tried on nearly everything in the store. I loved the unique selection of clothing and accessories, as it was different from the usual boutique brands. I left with quite a few purchases and a well-used credit card, and I can't wait to go back!!! Definitely check out The Standout in Oak Bay!!!

ChIJlbToxJp0j1QRlYWTHUBG9rM,Below the Belt,3.7,48.425179,-123.3675171,51,"I visited recently and I found the employee with the short hair/ buzz cut super cold. They didn‚Äôt help any customers and when I went up to the till to pay they just stood facing the other way and another employee had to come help me. They also never seemed to help any of the other staff who were working hard and thankfully were helpful while I was there.
I came into the store to try on some jeans (something I dread) and I'm so happy that I was assisted by Philip! He was so knowledgeable and kind. He asked me what type of fit I was looking for and advised me on how different Levi's would stretch a size over time. I'm so happy be recommended sizing down in Levi's Wedgies (with 1% elastane) because they certainly did relax in the seat and thighs.
He recommended different styles and I ended up buying three pairs. I'm so happy with how they fit and was incredibly impressed with Philip's help and attention.
Next time I look for jeans, I will stop by Below The Belt first and peek in to see if Philip is working! A rockstar employee! ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê
Horrible customer service. No greeting during the whole time in store. 2 associates just chatting to each other. When I asked questions, very minimal cold answers. Brands in store are nice but definitely not their staffs.
My first experience in this store today was an absolute 5 star experience, and all thanks to a staff member who definitely deserves recognition. Phillip greeted me quickly upon entering the store! He was very well dressed, kind, and approachable. He spent so much time helping me find the perfect pair of Levi's jeans and I honestly probably would have gotten overwhelmed and left without a purchase had he not helped me find exactly what I need.  He held up a conversation in a casual and comfortable way which had me feeling like I was shopping with a good friend and not just being helped by an employee. That is something that would have me coming back just to have that level of service.

If there's one thing we all can agree on it's that finding a perfect pair of jeans is like finding a needle in a haystack. Thanks to Phillips that became an easy and pleasant experience. ‚ù§Ô∏è

My question is - what is going on with the quality of Talbots clothing? I have items in my closet  that I bought at Talbots years ago that I can still wear. The items I purchased in December 2021 will be relegated to gardening gear  by summer. Truly disappointed customer.
The staff are friendly and always ensure that I receive any discount that's possible even if it isn't in effect until the next day. Today I grabbed some sweaters.
The quality of items isn't the same as it used to be and there are a lot of flimsy tops and knitwear that just won't last.  I have things in my closet from Talbots that are 20 years old and still look great.  The quality has declined.  On my visit today the clerk was impatient and rude and the store wasn't busy.  I miss the ""old"" Talbots.
I love visiting this store when I visit Victoria.  The clothes are fashionable, flattering, comfortable, and very well made. The store has a lovely welcoming atmosphere.  When browsing, I couldn't help but smile at the banter taking place between the staff and the customers.  And when they have a sale it is like no other...talk about indulging in retail therapy!  Way to go for Talbots!
Shopped before Christmas, boxing week some items price are changed higher to discount. Won‚Äôt do price adjustment. You can return but they won‚Äôt sell you again. Unbelievable! Manager is very rude and unprofessional. A staff state ‚Äú She is the manager, there is nothing we can do about it‚Äù. Will never be back!

I shopped on a Saturday night from the comfort of my own home. The website images inspired me cuz the owner is the real deal of a woman. She models her own clothes! I was looking for two summer tunics and found what I was looking for along with what I hoped would be perfect leggings. I sensed I could trust the sizing and images presented. So I placed my order. Then a box with a hand-written label addressed to me arrived on Wednesday the following week. When I opened the box, I was delighted to see that my expectations were met. Beautiful garments! And wrapped with care and attention to detail. Thank you Bodacious for being who you present yourself to be -- a celebration of the feminine in all her wisdom, elegance & beauty! Excellent & efficient service. Supremely gorgeous clothing. Loving detail. I will shop again soon!

I mainly worked with John, who was so knowledgeable and helpful and made sure I was happy with how my suit fit. I went around to a bunch of stores looking for menswear, but consistently ended up back at Outlooks for my entire look for the day (including belt, shoes, and shirt). A great curated selection of menswear with very helpful staff! Thanks John!
Absolutely wonderful experience! John helped me craft the most amazing suit for my wedding. It was my first time getting something tailored, and John made it a fun and collaborative experience. The end result was the most spectacular outfit I‚Äôve ever owned, beautifully arranged and perfectly fitted.

The whole team was extremely helpful every step of the way and made the whole process very approachable. Going to Outlooks was worth every penny! I‚Äôll definitely be back if I ever need another suit.
My partner and I went in looking for a suit for his sisters wedding. The customer service was awful... we left feeling so incredibly uncomfortable. We walked in and were not greeted, walked around for five minutes without having anyone acknowledge us, and then had to approach a worker in order to be helped (as someone who has worked in retail, I would consider the store to be not busy at this point). The gentleman that ""helped"" us seemed annoyed with our questions, did not give suggestions and/or help us to find other options, did not smile once and essentially just glared at us the whole time, and overall just created a very awkward and uncomfortable interaction. I saw other workers helping customers in a genuine and caring way while giving suggestions/feedback, however, we were not treated with the same level of service. Considering we are going to be paying $700+ for a suit, I would expect better.
I have been happy with the quality of clothing and the customer service at both the downtown and uptown locations.  Staff is friendly, knowledgeable and helpful and I‚Äôve always been treated well. Definitely my first stop in town whenever I need a new suit or tie
Other reviewers have captured the calibre of the styles and designs available for a variety of occasions.

Aside from this, I'd like to note that the customer service has been exemplary in each of my visits. The staff is knowledge on the fashionable pairings, trends, material and care for the products suggested.

Regardless of who's attending to me (sales staff, Tailor, etc.), I feel valued, respected and that my business is appreciated. I recommend this business without any hesitation, they are a lovely neighbour and wish them continued success.

A top in the window caught my eye for my daughter, about 15 minutes before closing. The sales associate was so helpful, even taking the top off the mannequin to get the size I needed. She inquired about my daughter‚Äôs age and made sure to give me a PST exemption because she‚Äôs a minor. She was so helpful and professional throughout the entire interaction. Plus, when I got home, my daughter adored the top like I knew she would! Great store, great service.
Everyone at Ricki's Hillside is so upbeat, helpful, and friendly. I always love going in there. And mostly I find some great new item at a decent price. The pants especially fit me well. I think by now 90% of the pants I own come from Ricki's. Thanks, team!
One Saturday afternoon, I popped in to Ricki's to return an online purchase.  I usually don't love going to stores these days finding it difficult to get help...often finding unengaged staff. This was not the case at Hillside.  Browsing, I was asked by two different employees if they could assist or start a change room for me.  Once I did try something on, the staff was super helpful and cheerful!  Regan at check out was great and completed my experience on a high note.  You have the most amazing team in this store and I will be sure to return -- thank you!
As always I find something I am looking for when I go to Ricki's Staff were so helpful and made sure it was the correct size and look and for me. Visit them you will be enjoy the experience whether it is a date night outfit, something for work or just something casual there is always something for you.

Hi Jackie;
Thanks for the fast great service from you.
Just wanted you to know that I picked up my new sweater & jeans today & they both fit - & look perfect together! I wasn't worried about the sweater but I thought maybe the jeans wouldn't be right (maybe I'd changed & my old jeans were no longer the correct 4P?) But no, I slipped into these new jeans like butter & now, I just have to wash them to be 100% sure. They seem exactly right.
What a great shop!  My daughter and I broke out after 2 months of Isolation to visit our favourite clothing store.  We felt so comfortable with the precautions in place and the staff were just wonderful.  They even had their signature gumdrops individually packaged for customer treats.

I went into the Hillside Suzanna‚Äôs this evening. The assistant asked me if I needed help to which I replied that I was just browsing.

I have worked in this store as a sales associate and the managers were racist and impolite to me and other previous sales associate. Also, the whole store is  TRASH!
Do not waste your money.
I have been here a couple of times now and I always seem to find something. Could have had one more sales person so while one was helping the other could have watched the cash register. It seems a sale was missed and it upset the ONLY sales person. I felt quite sorry for the sales person.

Went into the store to just browse and ended up purchasing some jeans all because of the service from Dawson and Johnathon. Dawson went above and beyond finding the unusual size I needed. I am definitely going to be making Plenty for Men the first stop if I need to search for some mens clothing. Thanks very much for a great shopping experience. You don't get that very often any more.
I enjoy shopping in Plenty women for myself and at Plenty Men for male members of my family.
This afternoon I went into the men‚Äôs store at Uptown Mall and noticed that 2 of the 3 male employees were wearing their masks below the nose.  We all know that it sucks that we are still having to wear masks, however we are still in the midst of a Pandemic and some people are doing their best to avoid getting sick.
I politely asked that the 2 guys wear their masks properly and they did so without a problem.  I feel that I should not have to ask, however.
The employees are a reflection of the integrity of the store management and if they are not wearing masks properly it speaks volumes about how much they do or don‚Äôt respect the public.  I felt you would want to know about this.
Other than this the service was great.

Thank you.
Men can get some snazzy clothing here and one stop shop for it too. Excellent prices and staff are helpful. Not to be missed.
I went there it was the best experience from a clothing store I‚Äôve been to designer shops and the people at Plenty blew them out the water for service and helping me choose clothes  10/10 I highly recommend going there. Also the building and the layout is very welcoming

ChIJx7vkTodzj1QRRiBdwlMlD9A,Warehouse One Victoria Hillside,4.1,48.44601,-123.33633,22,"For decades, I went to various stores to buy jeans. Very rarely did I find good fitting jeans for a good price.
I came into the Hillside store 3 yrs ago, and that was the last time I looked for anywhere else to buy jeans. Every time I have gone in, within seconds I was greeted by a staff member, and asked if they could help me.
After the first purchase, which was my best jean purchase in my life, I now just walk in and say, this is what I am looking for.
A staff member will take me right to what I need and show me any variations that are available. Usually there is a good sale going on too.
I would recommend this store to any middle aged man who is looking for nice looking, nice fitting jeans, without having to deal with some store that has no time for you, because they are too busy listening to their music loudly, or texting with friends.
Thank you for excellent service.
The staff was super friendly and helpful!! Love that store
Pleasant service, associate knew her products, I had to exchange jeans for different style ,not a problem,bought another garment.
I have always had great service at this location, but I went in today and the blonde lady working was all but helpful. She disregarded my presence in the store and had an extremely negative tone when talking to other customers. I will not be back!

They are clearly looking for specific pieces or brands as they are so full, why not communicate what they are looking for.
Also the pricing especially in this economy made me feel sick. I found at least 4 pieces I currently own and paid less for new on sale. I understand we all need to make money but have some decency.
This could be a wonderful little shop but seriously needs a vibe check.
I knew to expect higher prices since it‚Äôs consignment/curated but wow $20+ for a used plain black Gildan t-shirt is what to expect here. I guess those high prices can‚Äôt pay for an adequately sized cage for their two birds shoved into one very tiny cage together.

The only credit to them is they have cool pieces and the window displays are fair advertisements to what‚Äôs inside
Best Clothing store in town! The people that work there are super sweet and caring! Best clothes at a great price... would definitely check it out if in the area!
A few years ago I walked into pocket clothing with my partner and the lady who runs the store was very friendly and helpful. She sold me a pair of Louboutin high heels for $80 and assured me they were genuine. Along with it, I bought an Ecote handbag she told me was real Indian red leather. Turns out, years later when I went to inquire about my items, I was told they were fake. And the handbag was Urban Outfitters I believe. They were both fakes and I felt she took advantage of me and my partner being we were coming out of homelessness at the time. I mean, its one thing to make a sale and another to mislead a person into thinking they're buying something authentic when they're told so. Won't be returning, just to post this review to warn others.
Super cool place with great curation of alternative and fashionable options. I admire the window display everytime they change it - which is often! Seems I always want something in the window!! I've got some of my coolest and most unique clothing items from here. Highly reccomend checking it out, it's worth it.

Diana is fabulous very knowledgeable and helpful. So is Sebastian. Truly most of staff is nice there. Probably because Kim, the manager trains them well.

Love the quality of their clothes.
Jeans smell of mothballs after a first rinse in water. Multiple washings have not removed the stench. The manager had not heard of that before and only offered an exchange instead of a refund, so BR does not accept responsibility for defective products. A brief internet search reveals this mothball issue is a real thing. Will not buy there again, and I feel sorry for others who end up with the same problem. In the store there is no hint of mothball smell, it manifests only after you get home
Terrible service...
I ordered a couple things online under final sale.. loved them but that sizes were wrong and either the local store or online were willing to help. Refused to change the sizes for me and / or do a store credit.... no matter if it was ""final sale"", online ordering should always be subject to either option as the sizes specially at Banana Republic are not consistent.

I guess lesson learned... I was a regular shopper and this situation will for sure affect my shopping with Banana Republic.
My experience at Banana Republic in the Mayfair Mall in Victoria today was less than pleasant. I was not properly greeted, no eye contact was made, and I felt shoved out of the way by staff and customers when i was trying to look at the merchandise. I won‚Äôt darken their doors again.
Staff were great, I wish the sizing wasn‚Äôt so short though, mens fit used to be much better. I‚Äôd guess the people writing negative comments about customer service are probably clueless that Covid has affected service staff levels‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure it was traumatic not getting greeted, must be tough spending daddy‚Äôs dirty money all day, everyday. Sigh.

Great clothes, awesome staff, and phenomenal return/exchange/price guarantee policies. Quality of clothing is high and reliable from this brand. No loose threads or poor stitches or fabrics. Price is appropriate if not even a bit low for what you get. Great value for money. Lots of available styles to suit one's needs and desires. Sales are abundant and further the value. Thanks RW&CO.
Excellent selection and pricing. Always up to date on the fashion trends. The staff and manager are very friendly and provide professional customer service. Thank you!
Really Wonderful staff. Very helpful. And, add to that impressive collection. If you are looking for classic fashion, this is the place to be.
Big shout out to Steve for helping me find a wedding officiant outfit a few days ago. She was so helpful and kind. I only wish larger sizes were better stocked - the company itself doesn't seem very size inclusive, though perhaps it's a supply chain issue. But the staff here are great and I've had a good experience every time I shop here. :)

The store layout is kept pretty tidy and doesn‚Äôt feel dusty like some retailers can. The change rooms are large and there is rarely a lineup. Only gripe is the cashiers always seem to take a long time, I don‚Äôt know if this is because of their computers or just lack of experience!
They were able to return some ripped pants over 30 days past the purchase. Great customer service!
Thank you to Katie for helping my wife yesterday afternoon to pick out jeans! This was her first pair of jeans in a decade and she was not into jean shopping. Thanks for your body positivity and helpful attitude! (This is actually the wife writing, just don‚Äôt know how to sign into my google) hahaha
Good clothing, has lots of smaller sizes.
Store's clean too and the staff are good.
I visited this store a week ago and haven't posted a review yet only because I've been trying to come up with the words to properly describe how outstanding it was.  It was singlehandedly the best customer service experience of my life.  The manager, Courtney, was patient and attentive and kind and FUN and made shopping for jeans (which I was absolutely dreading after having gained weight) a delightful walk in the park.  Thank you to you and your team from the bottom of my heart!  It meant the world to me.

My friend and I recently bought some t-shirts and dresses here. The owner is very interesting to talk to and is interested to know what you think of the clothing that he imports for his shop. A great find in Fan Tan alley!
I love everything about this hidden gem of a store! The clothing is beautiful, with so many different prints and lovely fabrics and the jewellery was very nice as well. Allan is awesome, gives great customer service, and his little shop has a great vibe. We will definitely be back soon, thank you for the perfect new summer dress :)
Beautiful little boutique full of fun designs. The shop keeper was a warm and kind person who was helpful to us as tourists. Thank you, love the cat  shirt!
Awesome t shirt designs and lovely staff!
I just happened to be wandering along Fan Tan Alley and came across this shop.  Placed outside was a basket of lovely scarves that caught my eye. Went inside to purchase one and was very impressed with the collection of apparel, etc. I will definitely return on my next visit to Victoria this spring.

ChIJM2sayYR0j1QRt16ssbT2kIg,Flavour,4.3,48.4274552,-123.3679051,94,"Their clothes are super cute and I love the style, but unfortunately I have to give a bad review. Every time I‚Äôve been here the customer service is lacking. No one ever greets you, asks if you need a room or are friendly at all. My sister bought a dress here and wore it for a few hours and then the next morning wanted to wear it again, and there was already a hole in it. Cheap quality and bad service, will be skipping it from now on.
I discovered this store today and I absolutely fell in love!  They have great selection and very welcoming, energetic staff ! I‚Äôll be back!
Flavour downstairs has some good selection and reasonable prices. Flavour upstairs (vintage) is an absolute miss. It seems as though their entire collection is based on an 80 year old lady named Geraldine. A lot of the staff seem to embody that, with a general vibe of 'get off my lawn' instead of welcoming customers in. Many items are priced more expensive than their retail price... I'd say stick to downstairs storefront or avoid altogether.
They've done a great job of curating their clothing and the prices are all fair. Really funky clothing and great customer service. I had a really good experience with a girl named Lily who made our day! She was very kind and went out of her way to help us out.
I used to avoid this store because they carry a variety of brands and the sizing can be a bit of a nightmare if you're a curvier person like me.

The staff that are at this location now are very laid-back and approachable people. I really enjoyed my last visit and bought a gift for a friends birthday, and was pleasantly surprised when the sales associate helped me wrap the earrings and ensure it was ""gift ready"".

If you like cute clothes in various styles, definitely check this place out!

Yeah it's expensive but you get what you pay for. Amazing selection of brands and helpful staff definitely the place to go after a big pay day.
Entitled ownership and management that do not display in a clear and visible manner anywhere in their store, the fact that they do not do cash refunds. During my attempt at a return for a refund I reminded the cashier that I asked my salesperson during the purchase about a return, and was told that it was. Management then comes to explain to you that what his salesperson really meant the day before was - that a return is never for your hard earned cash back, but rather for this stores small print tucked away hidden policy of an in-store credit only. Poor!

Four Horseman Management - Your reply to my review is a joke!
Your attempt at trying to falsely flip the narrative and remove the focus of my NEGATIVE review from your HIDDEN no cash refund policy - to false claims about my behaviour is insulting to all those who read reviews. Your character in this regard only further undermines your business practices & credibility - from boutique to garage sale - buyer be ware!
The staff are always so nice and helpful, even if you are not buying anything. They prices can be high, but the quality of the items is as good as it gets. Everything is always clean and organized. It is much nicer then most other clothing stores.
I walked into the shop this summer on a mission to dress better and improve me style. The staff always has good feedback and knowledge if what they are selling. Were its from, where it's made, history if the company. Makes dressing an experience. Props.

Highly recommend, always!
I feel so cared for when shopping at Straith‚Äôs and end up with something special every time.

Someone once told me this, and I believe it to be true:‚ÄúYou can never look too good. If someone feels underdressed, that‚Äôs their problem.‚Äù
Been in here many times. Really good suits and clothing for that special occasion or just gifts for friends & family. The one guy who helped me manny is really knowledgeable and handsome.
Beautiful selection of fine men‚Äôs clothing. Best in class customer experience. 10/10 recommendation if you‚Äôre looking for a new suit or to update your wardrobe
I didn't end up buying a new suit today only because things were out of my price range (as a student) but the two brothers who run this establishment went out of their way to spend a great deal of time helping me try things on and explaining what to look for in a well-fitting suit. I'll be back for things within my price range for the next few years (shirts, socks, and accessories) and likely treat myself to a new suit from Kane Straith as a graduation present. I would recommend this store to anyone looking for high-quality menswear.

Apologies for giving you poor rating, product was better but customer handling could have been better.
I bought Nike Jordan last week along with Nike tees, was greeted & treated very well, appreciated during my first visit.

I decided to exchange my tees after couple of days of my visit, so I visited the showroom and was greeted by one of Employees and I handed over the tees and told her I want to exchange, poor experience started from
here.
She straight away said it‚Äôs not from this store I can‚Äôt exchange, one of your staff went back to check the stock and confirmed it‚Äôs from this store and I was kind of laughing, then she asked for Tag which I had but not along with Tees, had bill which they gave me, I think it was paid receipt, for actual bill copy I gave them my email Id on my first visit but I didn‚Äôt get my receipt on my email Id.
But then she asked for Bill, so I shown her that copy which I had and even while checking that receipt she said it‚Äôs not from
our store, I still had smile on my face( Awkward one), then after checking the name of Employee she could make out because she was working at that point of time and then asked when did you bought this stuff, I said last Friday and I visited on Monday, which means after 3 days of purchase, she was like, it‚Äôs been more than a week so we can‚Äôt exchange it‚Äôs in our policy and shown me their policy then I had to clarified, ‚Äú I took 3 days ago, last Friday.
Then she asked for email Bill which I didn‚Äôt received, but after checking my Junk finally I got my bill and was able to exchange and then I bought another Tees in exchange paid the difference, she took my almost 5-10 mins in all that conversation.
After the billing I left the store without even realizing that security Tag wasn‚Äôt removed by the cashier, on which she has to call me back even when I was few steps away from store one of their staff came and informed me about the Tag, which actually beep while I was exiting but I didn‚Äôt even realized that it still had Tag.

She was rude, she assumed I am here to ask for a refund and trying to be a fake customer even without realizing and hearing my concern she predetermined everything, I was like, this is how you treat you customer who comes for return or refund.

I visited on dated 15th May around 2pm, just hope your staff may learn some basic etiquette and few customer handling skills could have been better for the brand, predetermining everything could have been worse at times.
She spoiled the day.
This is the perfect place to shop street wear in Victoria. Staff there are really kind and helpful. I really love the ‚Äúone pair of shoes for one household‚Äùrule when new shoes drop. It gives everyone equal chance to get the shoes for retail price. That‚Äôs really considerate. I‚Äôll definitely go there all the time.
Complex brings big city streetwear products and atmosphere to the Island with no compromise. I never thought I would find such a great selection of sneakers when I moved to the Island. They have kept it real since 1998 and it shows, great shop.
Always cater to anything I need and offer me a room, if I am questioning a product they show me similar ones and don‚Äôt pressure

Lovely down-to-earth diner frequented by workers around the rock bay area. Ran by a very hard working couple. Ginger beef is an ample portion and I liked the celery garnish.  Will try calling in next time to pre order for lunch which nigjt be faster.
Don‚Äôt understand the raves. Want a cheap no frills egg breakfast? It‚Äôll do the job. But if you want a great breakfast, this isn‚Äôt that. It‚Äôs ‚Äúokay‚Äù. Nothing wrong with ‚Äúokay,‚Äù but the ratings are way too high here for what you get.

Five stars should be memorable, flawless, clean, etc. I don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs any of those things. But if you‚Äôre looking for a $7.50 breakfast plate, it‚Äôll be fine.

I don‚Äôt recommend the eggs Benny.
This unassuming little hideaway in the commercial district of Victoria offers the fast solution for the ""working man's"" appetite. Burgers, sandwiches and an all day breakfast seem to the mainstay of this establishment plus the constant flow of customers picking up take out orders. The portions are always on the larger side just by looking at what orders were nearby. I ordered an omelette and it was ok, nothing special. The decor would have been appropriate for the 70's but the food arrives fast. Order at the counter and self serve for coffee. I'd go back.
Love Love Love this place. Food is amazing and so are the owners. Best place to grab lunch and you can pre order via a phone call for pickup. Bring cash, there is no credit cards accepted here. Menu is reminiscent of old style soda shops and the comfort food is bang on.

Waitress was wonderful, I asked to be seated by the window because it was a beautiful day out and she kindly accommodated.

We ordered...
-calamari (4/5 was a little lacking in flavor, but great portion)
-prawn skillet from the appetizer menu (5/5 for sure, so flavorful it was my favorite)
-and I think I had the seafood linguine (4/5 definitely a lot of pasta compared to the amount of seafood actually given, flavor was a little lacking but still good)

Definitely walked away full with leftovers, so it's worth it :)
I loved Frankie's Modern Diner! The food, ambiance, service, and energy was absolutely incredible. Our waitress was super polite and friendly. The food was 11/10 delicious! As a burger conniseur, the Chicken Parmesan Burger was the best burger I've ever had. The portions were large and well worth the price; I actually left full which is out of the ordinary for me. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone and will have to return! I had an amazing experience.
Amazing diner with lots of options for vegan and vegetarian folks(even at 7am).

We tried vegan dishes such as oatmilk pancakes and falafel hash and, both were really good. Have to give special shout out to falafel hash as that was something I never had before. Taste was really good and falafels were soft(not unnecessarily over fried).

Staff was friendly and served us really well.
Amazing experience to dine here awesome food. It‚Äôs location is so perfect we landed up going here twice in 3 days üòÄ The food is delicious highly recommend the veg lasagna for vegetarians. Chicken parmesan had the crispiest chicken and all flavours came so well together. Also the fish and chips. The best was key lime pie ü§§. Must visit when in Victoria.
I literally had the best waffle of my life today. I had the banana praline waffle and it was magnificent! My husband had the churro waffle and he was in heaven. My son had the chicken and waffles for breakfast and he loved it! We had a great experience and the prices are very reasonable.

Being a chain restaurant, I really didn't have high expectations. I was very pleasantly surprised by the whole experience! Nice clean atmosphere, great wait staff, and surprisingly delicious food. I had the spicy chicken sandwich with truffle fries, and would definitely come back again for more. Is it the most unique restaurant I've ever been to? No. But the consistency of food and service would certainly bring me back again!
Ordered off a deliver app and the ribs I got were a bit dry. I called moxies and asked if anything could be done. They gave me a few options and remade my meal. It‚Äôs delicious and the ribs are perfect!

They went above and beyond with their customer service and even added a brownie bite I was not expecting.

Thank you moxies for the great customer service and really good food! I will be back :)
Consistent and delicious. If you have the time I recommend. Brea is a sweetheart. Ribs, Gyoza  and calamari/shrimp tempura are always good appetizers. Salmon is always nicely cooked it Medium or medium well they cook it medium rare. Steak, mushrooms, mash, gravy and beef dip were all really nice options.
September 2/21 visit: happy hour Red Sangria $6 and Dry Ribs $10; ribs order quite large, took half home.

The Prawn Tagliatelle ($23.75) comes with a slice of garlic toast. The nicely presented entree was delicious, one of the best pasta dishes I've had. Especially like the capers in the sauce, and on the garlic toast it's like the best bruschetta ever.

Service was quick, the atmosphere lively (bit on the noisy side) and busy.

They are training new hosts and servers; servers Tony and Heather were great.
Busy place, fine food, good service!

Good experience, nice atmosphere but little noisy. Busy on a Saturday evening.
Sirloin steak was done just right, lots of veggies - almost too much! The food was nicely seasoned and nicely presented.
Only issue - the steak knife was not very sharp.

Staff were professional, not overly friendly but made me feel welcome.

The crab cakes eggs benny is a must try!
Very flavorful crab cakes topped with sliced avocado and a perfectly poached egg, tasty potatoes on the side and a creamy and zesty hollandaise sauce to pour over top.

Buffalo chicken wings were thickly breaded and really delicious.

The seafood chowder was filled with yummy bites.

The french toast was amazing! It had so much flavour on it's own but then it was paired with fruits and a cinnamon whip on the side, you hardly have a need for any syrup.

The Reuben was juicy and not overly salty as others can be.

The calamari was a bit odd and the least flavorful thing I tried.

The steak was my absolute favourite dish, perfectly cooked with a delicious flavoured butter and nice crust on the outside and rich sauteed mushrooms.

The fish and chips were exactly what you'd expect and they do have good fries.

The cappuccino chocolate terrine dessert was nice and rich without being overly sweet, despite it missing the raspberry sauce as advertised. The chocolate was smooth and the almond bark on top was crunchy. I'm not actually sure where the cappuccino flavour is meant to be but I'm an espresso addict so I tend to not be able to taste coffee flavours unless they are overly pronounced.
Dropped in for a nightcap and between my husband and I we had 6 delicious drinks.  I asked for a espresso martini which was not on the menu and they delivered it with a smile. Sandeep was very knowledgeable about the drinks that was served and made us feel at home. The bartender really is outstanding at his profession as well as quick.  And the restaurant itself is very clean, cozy, and esthetically pleasing to the eye.
This was an incredible experience and I thoroughly enjoyed myself and so did my company. You must try this. Fun for all ages. I wish them all the success . What an amazing concept
A great experience!

The ambiance is very welcoming and charming. Amazing cocktails, food and service. Staff are extremely knowledgeable and make great recommendations.

Our bartender was great with the cocktails and the host (Sandeep) was very knowledgeable, he explained to us the drinks we had and made great recommendations.

Do yourself a favor and go for an experience of being comfortable in great hands with great food and cocktails.

M Club lounge was closed at Victoria Marriott Inner Harbour during our 2 nights stay. We were provided breakfast at Fire & Water Restaurant located within the hotel.

The staff recommended ‚ÄúCrab Cake Eggs Benedict.‚Äù We both went with her recommendation. Wow, she was on point! Rich, tasty and melt in your mouth. Hubby loved it so much he ordered it again the next morning. The next morning I ordered ‚ÄúAll Canadian breakfast‚Äù as I love scrambled eggs and chose rye bread, bacon and substituted potatoes with fruit.

I have to say the staff is amazing - attentive, genuine and down-to-earth.

Great breakfast to fuel us for the day full with walking. We ended up needing to walk off the wonderful meal along the harbour. Not a bad start to a day, eh!

I ended up ordering the tasting menu because I wanted to try items I wouldn‚Äôt regularly order and I‚Äôm happy to say each plate turned out amazing.

Our chef explained each dish in detail, so I will spare my attempt at doing that and say that if you go, I'd reccomend sitting at the bar. He is very inspired and passionate about his craft. We were lucky the owner was there to bring each glass of wine to life!

I'm very much looking forward to returning for another incredible evening.

We ordered and shared the Walnut and Arugula pesto & the Cheeseburger with potato fries . Each bite was like the first time you experienced Disneyland for the first time . Clark , the Culinary Artist  and part owner,  personally checked to see how our meals were. His attention to detail and passion for his craft is why we will return to experience many of the other incredible menu items .

My favorite was bloody merry with pineapple, shrimp, mozzarella and kabanos. We had a quick lunch while exploring city during our cruise stop at Victoria. Lovely island with lovely parks and scenery.
I took mushroom soup which was too bland for me but spinach artichoke dip and my husbands tacos were excellent. Price was very good as well.  Service was very quick.
Restaurant looked super busy but was able to be sat in less than 5 minutes. Fast service and food was delivered in a reasonable amount of time.

Fish Tacos with Fries, Sweet & Fire Cauliflower, Margarita, Peach Bellini were all delicious.

Food was fresh and drinks were strong!  Plenty of outdoor seating. Family friendly, close to the water. Highly recommend if your in the area.
Enjoyed Happy Hour at Milestones Grill + Bar on the famed Victoria Harbour. Fortunate to get an outdoor table on a beautiful summer day. The food and service were excellent and thoroughly enjoyed the fish tacos and bloody Mary's. The location is also hard to beat with all the energy of harbour life including sailboats, water taxis, seaplanes, cruise ships, power boats, tourists and sidewalk vendors. Well worth checking it out!
Delicious food, and excellent staff. We went to Victoria for our 14th anniversary, and chose Milestones for a romantic dinner. The atmosphere wasn't as romantic as we had hoped, but the other diners seated around us seemed like they were having a wonderful time, and it really helped boost our mood. We liked it so much, we went back the next day for brunch while we waited for the ferry.
The staff were attentive to our large group despite it being a busy night for them, and the food was some of the best restaurant food I've had in awhile. I had my baby with me and they were able to provide a high chair and bring water for his bottle when I needed it.
This restaurant has some really fun cocktails and lots of choice on their menu for a special night out. The view of the harbour was a lovely addition to a great meal. This restaurant would be a good choice for a party or date.

This quiet but trendy restaurant tucked downstairs in a brick building had wine racks everywhere and twinkly candles .  The menu was ‚Äútasting style‚Äù meaning easy to share the plate , and the food was very tasty. Everything was totally fresh and delicious
Nothing to cry about here! Really enjoyed my first (but not last) time at wind cries mary. Sat at the bar with a friend for some share plates & cocktails - loved the vibe and most of the dishes.
Great concept with some perfectly executed dishes! Personally felt the portions were a little small for a family style meal, but that gives a great excuse to try more items off the menu!
Highly recommend the seafood dishes, especially if you're new to Victoria!
Heard a lot of great stuff about this place and was super excited to try it, but was pretty disappointed. We got the mushroom gnocchi dish, fried chicken, curried tuna, and all three of the dessert offerings. Mushroom pasta dish was probably the most disappointing, really lacking flavor, but the texture was perfect. Fried chicken was great on top but was set atop a very thin sauce that made the bottom of the chicken really soggy. Curried tuna was perfectly cooked but again, lacking in flavor and begging for salt. The three desserts were a real let down. One of which was plain cookies (I would be willing to bet they were tollhouse). Chocolate torte was crying for some flake salt. And the third dessert was really dry and unremarkable. All thing considered, the line cooks are doing a good job, but the menu isn‚Äôt worth the price at all. Would save your money and go to stage.

ChIJIShj8Jp0j1QRcsWjkgzn4ac,Little Jumbo Restaurant and Bar,4.5,48.42527,-123.36928,1192,"Excellent bar with sophisticated cocktails. Perfect fancy date night bar. As a tourist, I went out of my way to find a non-tourist cocktail bar and they delivered. They have an eclectic and extensive assortment of spirits. Knowing it was dedicated to historic bar masters I had high hopes, but it truly exceeded my expectations. Anytime I'm back in Victoria I'll be visiting again.
Came here to celebrate me taking my nursing exam. This place is the bomb!! We shared the little Jumbo burger which was soooooo good. It comes with Parmesan fries. We also had the short rib which was some of the best I've had. The meat was very soft and fatty and I loved the unique flavors it was paired with. There were blueberries, deep fried polenta, and I think some mayo. It was so good!!!

The ambience inside is super nice and intimate. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of chatting with the bartender Clayton who was so so nice. I had a lemonade but my boyfriend had a very smokey mai tai cocktail which was really good. Will definitely come back!
Nice cocktails and friendly service. Would have loved to try their tartare but they ran out. The mushroom pate was delicious -earthy and rich. The vongole was not what I expected but was a delicious balance of tomatoes and clam flavour. The seafood soup with the fish was wonderful -the fish was not just poached but panseared so it still had a nice crust. Mussels and clams were fresh and juicy.
Excellent service and good quality meals. They specialize in a few dishes so chocies are limited, the reason for only 4 stars is that we went for dinner and they ran out of spaghetti and steak which was what I wanted and the expensive cocktails are tiny! I almost started chuckling when I received my Mononoke, pretty much a fancy shot for $20. Somethings on their menu are justified with the prices (like the wagyu beef burger!) but definitely not the cocktails nor the tuna tartare (very small amount of tuna with filler). Took almost 50 mins to get out burgers but service was top notch and atmosphere was decent, not as romantic as other reviews mebtioned, especially when it's busy!
My wife and I had a wonderful experience. We have been to similar restaurants in Victoria but this place is at the top of the list. Our server was really great. The food was amazing. Also the bartender is on point he is a master behind the bar. We already have reservations with some of our friends. Can't wait

Maybe not a sanctuary, but there was a mother deer and her fawn grazing in the grass. Truly amazing experience at dinner.
I had the beef short rib, it was slow roasted over 48 hours! Resulting in tender and delicious beef.  Tasted amazing with the sauces included.
This is a perfect date spot, and I would highly recommend it if you're looking for something special!
What an incredible restaurant!
The beet appetizer has such a great texture. The dumplings had the most delicious peanut sauce. The lamb and pork were both cooked beautifully. The potatoes and vegetables on the side had perfect seasoning. The Demi glaze was perfect with a beautiful rosemary flavour. The mascarpone cheesecake with blueberry and lemon was truly delightful.

Thank you for such an incredible meal!
A neighborhood high-end restaurant that starts serving dinner at 4pm.  Chef also runs front of house and greets customers herself.  Recommend calling in for a reservation as the restaurant is short staffed.  You can discuss your dietary restrictions with the chef and request to add extra protein or carbs to you main dishes.  Pasta and fish dish changes daily.  Lots of cocktail and wine selection.
This place is great! They are on the 2nd floor, and they have the patio as well!

Lamb rack is very good, with nice display, very delicious on the lamb!

The filet mignon is very good as well, good cooked, and nice display too.

The dessert is very nice as well, hot with vanillia ice cream, tastes the best!

From the beginning before entered the restaurant, we saw the deer or coyote on the opposite grass, very cute!
Lovely neighbourhood restaurant with extremely fresh, tasty, and comforting meals. You could tell they were made with love. We had the gnocchi to share as a starter, ribs, and then sampled all the desserts‚Äîthe sticky toffee pudding was to die for!

The owners are also incredibly nice, which made it a really fun dining experience.

Oh, and well-priced cocktails, to boot!

ChIJG0qUo5p0j1QRJZTgAA9kdys,Pagliacci's,4.4,48.4244429,-123.3664177,3614,"We came for dinner on an early Monday evening and there was already a lineup. The host told us that it was the ‚Äúfastest moving lineup in Victoria‚Äù and, not too long after, we were seating inside.

The atmosphere was very lively and the decor had lots of interesting things to look at.

Overall, the food was delicious! The house-bread was so good that we just couldn‚Äôt stop eating it. We ordered an assortment of appetizers including the Crab Cakes, Meatballs and Mezze Platter; and for mains, we tried a couple seafood pastas and mixed seafood bowl.

The portions were substantial although the amount of seafood in of the pastas wasn‚Äôt as abundant compared to other dishes. Also, some shrimps could have been cleaned better.

We also tried several drinks and cocktails; and, they were nice. We sat close to the bar so, the bartender took good care of us personally.

The rest of the staff was very friendly and diligent as well.
When they say they‚Äôll find you a spot and the lineup will be fast they mean it! It‚Äôs so busy and booming with life in this restaurant and makes for great atmosphere. The food was delicious, we got the Minnesota Fats to start, followed by The Prawn Broker and The Big Easy for our main. We also had sangrias on tap, and a glass of wine each. The service was great considering how busy it is, there‚Äôs always someone making sure every table has what they need and asked for in a timely manner. I highly recommend eating here if you‚Äôre in Victoria, all around great experience.
We stop by this place for lunch and love it! All the staff was super friendly, helpful, and kind. We enjoy talking with them. Everything we ordered from the food and drink was savory! They have such a huge selection of lunch and drinks.
The restaurant itself is small, but they do offer outdoor sitting. Walk-in only. First, come serve. Thursday to Sunday they offer live jazz music. Check them out if you are in the area.
The food (pasta) at this place was amazing!!!

I ordered The Shell Game dish and I got to say it's probably one of the best pasta dish I ate. The only complaint I have was that the size of the food is small so definitely go for size Large as it's just a few dollars more!

The happy hour appetizers were also good.

The service was also excellent although I can see our waiter is way too busy (it was crowded) so he forget us a couple times but he was pleasant nonetheless. The setting is sort of very crowded (tables too close) so that's the only real downside.

I'm definitely coming back here again if I'm at Victoria Island.
This restaurant is what my food dreams are made of. Everything, and I mean everything, was the closest to perfect I have ever experienced. From the clever item names, to the perfectly procured *local* (silk road brand) tea, and the live band. We shared the duck wings (a little spicy, perhaps too spicy for some), and I had the enchantment under the sea salad. Unfortunately, they were all out of salmon, but their grilled chicken did not disappoint. Bring a hefty wallet (worth every penny), your appetite, and enjoy!

However, food wise we only liked the Korean cauliflower per the suggestion from the waitress. My green salad was missing tomatoes and had almost no pumpkin seeds and cranberries. Felt very cheap. My friend power bowl had no sauce, and so little quinoa. Again not impressed and we were disappointed. Sangria were good. I‚Äôm willing to come back but I might stick to burgers.
A friend took me to McRae's for the first time and I was a little disappointed with the food I received. Granted, the restaurant was quaint. To start, my friend and I shared the hummus that was in the 'share plates' section and it was delicious. The naan bread/pita tasted super good with the hummus and the carrots was crispy and fresh. We weren't super hungry so we got a grilled cheese and the mac and cheese off of the happy hour menu. Can't go wrong with the grilled cheese, nice and crispy. The mac and cheese on the other hand, it was really disappointing. The cheese sauce they used made the whole thing super unappetizing, also the cold cheese and breadcrumbs on top just made it worse. Also it was lukewarm, it did not taste fresh at all. The service was alright, there was a lack of eye contact super mediocre.
I was at the restaurant a few days ago and sat outside on there front patio. It's not an ideal spot to sit when it's cold out since they only have one working heater for the entire space. As for food, it was tasty. I had a breakfast sandwich and fries. The fries were crispy and delicious! The service was decent enough but it was hard to hear our server. She spoke really quietly and didn't look super happy to be there, but we got everything we asked for which is good. I'd probably go back but I'd be more careful about where I sit.
-good nachos, not a huge serving
-blue moon wings were great, came with carrots and dip
-sat outside on the patio with the heater
Food was great 10/10
Atmosphere was cool but very loud 7/10
Service was ‚Äúneed to work on it‚Äù 4/10

Waitress was kinda rude, she was like pushing us to leave by coming to check while we‚Äôre talking and taking longer to eat our food, and then she asked us if we‚Äôre ready for the bill !
Once we are I guess we can call you and ask you ourselves to get us the bill !
No one is running away before paying your tips !

So yummy, very kind. I had the green chicken enchiladas and it was the perfect amount and super yummy! Highly recommend!
Yeah, so friendly and very delicious. Enjoyed our Chilada‚Äòs and this amazing chocolate and custard cake. Loved it.

From the fresh delicious food, great staff, to the one of a kind decor, this is a local legend of a restaurant.
We had a pleasant brunch with my wife and my friends. The service is excellent and they even helped us in choosing the menu. We ordered Meat lovers hash, Odd couple, valdys frittata and turkey sausage. The chicken strips and the turkey sausage were really good. We will be visiting here for our next trip to Victoria hopefully.
Excellent place for breakfast and lunch in Victoria. Interesting environment with iconic photos of great personalities all over the walls. Their homestyle potatoes were perfectly seasoned. I would definitely recommend to try this restaurant if you are close by.

The food was very good, but I wouldn‚Äôt suggest the kale Caesar salad, as it was too salty (this is coming from a person who enjoys salt). Modern and artsy. We‚Äôll be back :)
Wow, wow, wow.

Incredible, locally sourced and seasonal ingredients crafted into well-balanced, playful and beautiful dishes. Comfortable, intimate atmosphere. Well-trained, knowledgeable, friendly staff. Perhaps the strongest cocktail program in the city with simply transcendent cocktails crafted by a bar staff who can build layer upon layer if flavour.
Totally blown away by the prix fixe menu we had a couple weeks ago. From the cocktails to the dessert everything was simply incredible. Best part of the courses were they were all things I wouldn't have normally ordered for myself and I love each and every one of them.
The seafood pasta is outstanding!! I forgot to take a photo of the chicken sandwich and was so delicious, very crispy outside and soft inside.

The atmosphere was so chill and I think the place is perfect for cozy dinner dining. The owner Segar and his partner both know the industry very well that's why their food was awesome.

It's my first time visiting The hallway. My boyfriend and I had a fantastic experienceüôèüèΩüëç The beautiful ceiling lighting gives me a rolls royce ceiling lights vibe and I LOVE IT.

While the service was fine but not great, the food falls short of inspiration or taste.  Nonetheless, the picturesque location may still appeal to those seeking a scenic dining experience with average culinary offerings.
Some of the most creative food we have had in a while. The combination of flavours was great. Fantastic views of the harbour. Easy parking at the hotel, which is free if dining there. Great night out.
Ambiance was great. Stablefish and crab cakes were amazing. The chefs seared and crisped up the skin on the fish perfectly.
Lindsey our server was sweet and attentive. All staff in the restaurant have been amazing since our stay.
Definitely recommend!
Extraordinary ambience and beautiful beach view added with good selection of delicious food and drinks. My favourite dish is 48 Hour short rib. Lamb meatballs for appetizers was also good. Calebaut Dark Chocolate Mousse is a must try desert.
Let‚Äôs start with the positive. View is extraordinary, you get to see the inner harbour from a very good angle. Staff are friendly and helpful. Now the terrifying part is the food which is a hit and miss. Chicken wings were amazing. Burger, sandwich, and fish and chips were horrifying. It‚Äôs hard to screw up fish and chips on the island. So many other places do it so well. The batter was very thick AND soft. Thick batter we have seen, but soft thick uncooked batter is weird. As for the the burger and sandwiches, bacon was very hard, patty all you taste is salt, and the buns were quite burned. Fries, some were not folly cooked. Manager was quick to address our experience. People here are nice, but I don‚Äôt know if I would risk the chance for the food though.

Highly recommended while being in Victoria especially around Dallas road. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
We ordered a screaming hot burger, onion rings, and a turkey sadwich for $21.  A side of 3 pickle slices was $1.20. The onion rings felt like they were fried for two days. My burger had me screaming in regret. The sadwich made me sad. I was confused if this was how my order was supposed to be. If you're looking for the place that's got that juice, this ain't it. But they have some ice cream.
My friend and I decided to go here for lunch.
We went inside as the line was short.
It was super busy and very loud.
When I picked up our food, I noticed that I got French fries instead of the onion rings I ordered .
I asked for them to be replaced.
Then, to make things easier, I said I would eat the fries.
The gentleman helping me said he would bring me onion rings.
I was truly disappointed as they were stuck together and way over fried.
I had to go back to get sauce for chicken fingers and was told I had to pay. Even though 1 pk is included.
He ended up bringing the sauce over, not knowing we had none.
Then it was time to get into my burger.
It wasn't even warm.
I took it  back and asked for my money to be refunded.
The same gentleman brought me my $ to the table.
I have been to this place so often and have had excellent burgers.
Today was a disaster.
On top of that, the same gentleman had to ask an employee to get up from one of the tables that is for paying guests.
The two older ladies actually apologized for asking her to move.
Wth?
What is the matter with this generation ?
I have yet to call the manager and put in a complaint.

I get that fast food places get busy.
It was one issue after the other today.
I'm completely disappointed with my visit today.
Breakfast, Lunch and Dinner.. Burger, Fries , Hotdogs and DESSERTS!!! Can have it all. I'd love Can-Mex if I go there for Breakfast, and their combos.. Dinners and Poutines I'd love. Patio is nice to dine in, and if you're lucky enough,  You'd get some Peacocks to visit you. Very rare but it happens. Summer , is crazy with long line up yet Fast service.

It was a tasty dish with a hint of spice that gave it an extra kick. I also loved the homemade salsa sauce - it was so good that I ended up buying a bottle to take home with me.

The service was also very friendly and fast. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and welcoming, and it was right next to the sea which.

For dessert, I decided to try the churros pancakes which were simply delicious. However, I must say that they were a bit too sweet for my taste.

Additionally, there were plenty of parking spots available right in front of the restaurant which made it very convenient. Overall, I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a tasty breakfast with a great view and friendly service.
I had a rare Monday off and we happened to be downtown so we popped in here for brunch. I'd heard good things and my expectations were exceeded. From the friendly attentive service, fresh coffee and timely refills, helpful menu recommendations. Everything sounded so good. We finally narrowed down our choices. My wife had the Fuego Benny and I went with the Fried Chicken and Cornbread French Toast with side of blueberry coulis.
The flavours and textures and presentation are spot on.
It was all just so good and we left happy and very full.
Special thanks to our server Michelle for excellent service.
Can't wait to come back!
Very few Mexican restaurants have the right touch and atmosphere. This is an incredible gem right on Victoria harbour. Food is amazing and the decor is fantastic with priceless huge posters of the Mexican revolution and old town feel.  I always come when I visit Victoria. Try the Divorciados eggs and corn bread. They are superb!
Great place. The food was excellent. They have a really cool courtyard in the back. The food was very filling and tasty. The breakfast burrito was amazing. The staff seemed a bit annoyed and short with us. Otherwise it would have been a 5 star rating.
Amazing food. I got the chiliqueles which pulled pork. Sooo good. Had to try the cornbread which was fantastic. Great overall dining experience. I'm coming back for the chimichanga

Finally tried this place, it didn‚Äôt quite live up to the reviews. Spring rolls were great. The red curry & the cashew chicken weren‚Äôt bad. The chicken pad Thai was easily the worst I‚Äôve ever had - No flavour and the saddest amount of chicken. I would have returned it if I lived closer.
A great place to eat, with good service, and tasty food.
My only complaint is that they leave the tails on the shrimp when they serve them, but I‚Äôm sure you could ask for the tails off.
The lunch combo is so good. It is a good deal,  tofu green curry combo and Thai iced tea for around $18, excellent value and super delicious food.

The food is some of the best I‚Äôve ever tasted. I got there in time for happy hour and tasted two amazing appetizers for $8 total. One was made from only chickpea flour and deep fried to perfection served with a delicious spicy sauce. The second delicious piece was grilled pork belly. The flavour was fabulous. I ordered the Kalettes veggie main course and again the flavours didn‚Äôt disappoint. Rich and unusual while being amazing. My server strongly recommended the chocolate dessert which I cannot say enough about. It was sweet, salty, creamy and decadent without being overpowering. Overall the meal was 5 star. The vibe of the place is calm and smooth while being friendly and relaxed. I will definitely be back.
Delicious food with an intimate atmosphere. The Kamut chicken slider and the wasabi fries were unexpected highlights. There definitely were more blistered peppers in two orders than four people could tackle, so I‚Äôd start with one order next time. The pork belly bite had amazing flavours but was more of a jerky than other pork belly dishes I‚Äôve had before. The Parisian gnocchi main was delicious but extremely heavy - we thought it might have been deep fried. Fun little place for a girls night out.

The food was well prepared and the presentation was simple but perfect for this particular place.

We had the Escargot Bourguignon and French Onion soup to start... both very delicious !

We enjoyed the 6oz New York Steak with Lobster... the steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection!

We also had the Shrimp scampi which was served with a very delicate but flavorful white wine sauce... yummy!

The hours are 4pm to 8pm... we went as a walk in and were lucky to get a seat; I would recommend a reservation.
Good friendly service and attentive. They had a special for steak and lobster with a salad. The lobster was good but the steak was lower quality for sure. The bread was good though. You will need a vaccine card to dine in. They are only opened during dinner hours.
Celebrated my husband's birthday in this quaint and home style atmosphere. Waitress was attentive. Food was very good. Been in business for 40+ years. Would eat here again
Service was good. But non-alcoholic cocktails contain alcohol. 5 months ago, I had gastric cancer surgery. so absolutely alcohol is dangerous to me. also, my friend's food has a kitchen iron brush. My birthday dinner has become a risky meal.
4/5 and 4/6/23:  It‚Äôs not often good cuisine meets stellar service and wonderful atmosphere!  As a solo diner, I didn‚Äôt feel slighted and was seated at a window table.

Amazing! We've visited the Ruby on Johnson, and had an incredible breakfast before, so we figured we'd try this location too.

Incredible (seriously) service, with 100-watt smiles. Not sure what our server's name was, but she absolutely earned her Wonder Woman tattoo (thank you again for a wonderful experience)!

The food was as delicious (and filling) as our previous experience. The mountains of waffles had our kids on cloud nine, while the breakfast tacos were a slam dunk for the grown ups. I'm not sure what they were called, but the ones with bacon are absolutely phenomenal - especially when drizzled with their homemade garlic hot sauce.

Yeah, we'll be back, all right. :)

A delightful lunch enjoyed at a slightly lower price with a birthday coupon.  The Whiskey River BBQ, Red Robin Gourmet Cheeseburger and Onion Rings were all perfect.  Coke refills are more pleasing.  The friendly and attentive server made the meal time enjoyable.  I went right at opening time, but soon a lot of people came.  There is a large parking lot in the back, so don't worry about parking.

There was a little bit of rubbish on the floor and the bathroom was a bit dirtybut other than that we had a good time. $400 for 9 people with wine , drinks and meals + two Meals for takeout is pretty good! The pickles were a bit soggy.

Ordered through Uber eats. Did not receive cheese dip. Subbed fries but received a side salad? I even ordered gravy but that didn‚Äôt clue them into providing me with the fries I ordered. Also ordered side bbq  but they added that to my cheeseburger instead making it gross and soggy. Did not receive dip for Yukon chips. It was such lays wavy chips? Lots went wrong here. Wish I got fries to make me feel better. I can maybe drink the gravy to relieve my pain?

ChIJWddTgKJ0j1QRB7nwCl9R_WM,IL Covo Trattoria,4.6,48.4219095,-123.3804821,1090,"We came here for our birthday dinner after hearing several recommendations from locals. We made reservations the night before, but I would do it several days out of possible. Everything was so yummy! We shared a salad and main dish. The wait staff were very friendly and helpful.
Lovely spot! Definitely make reservations ahead of time as it fills up quickly. They gave us a little tiramisu for our birthday! Bathrooms are gendered, but individual rooms.
Great experience all around. I'd say a 4.8 if we could be more precise and definately would recommend and would come back again. Carpaccio was excellent and the antipasto would be worth the visit for a nice glass of wine for a quick visit. Pasta special for the night was tasty but I could have used a bit more cream in it.

Service was great.

The only very minute critique was that I've had a phenomenal panna cotta before so it wasn't my best and although it was great, I enjoy it a bit less gelatanous but it was still great.
Lovely little italian restaurant. The food was absolutely incredible! I‚Äôm not much a fan of typical-faux italian food but this was the real deal, and boy was it delicious. I have celiac and I really appreciated the fact that they labelled the gluten free (upon request) versions of their food. Not only did they offer me gluten free pasta but I got free gluten free toast with their bread dipping oil! I was so incredibly impressed by this, I didn‚Äôt feel left out while my crew ate the pre dinner focaccia bread. Wish every restaurant offered this!
I got to try their Carpaccio, I had never tried raw beef before but it was simply amazing. The meat was tender and easy to bite and the combo of parmesan and arugula really elevated the dish.
Il Covo is a place that we have wanted to try for years. Having finally had the opportunity to eat there I can confidently say that our expectations were exceeded by miles.

I had the risotto special (Creamy Saffron Risotto with Beef Stew) and my wife had the Tagliatelle al Genovese. Both were fantastic. The prosciutto and melon was also good. The dessert cannoli were amazing.

We will likely go back for other special occasions.

Staff is super friendly and the food is amazing. The burgers don‚Äôt come out looking picture perfect but they taste amazing!  And the veggie chips are a great alternative to fries!  Plus pinball machines to entertain you while they are making your order!  Definitely a must stop if you are in Victoria!
The burgers and fries are great. They are cooked fresh when ordered and the ingredients are all locally sourced/ made.

This started as a food truck business which still goes strong in the summer. They also have a storefront with a few tables and some pinball games. It is very pared down. You go for the food and the friendly service not the ambiance.
I ordered the deluxe chicken burger it was incredible it was huge! And I would recommend it was delicious I would come again
One of the best veggie burgers I've had in a long while. Vegan mayo was silky and luscious! Pickles remind me of the ones made by my great aunt when I was a kid. Root veggie chips could be a meal on their own! Fun vibe, beautiful mural and atmosphere, caring staff, super clean, welcoming and inclusive space, and... PINBALL MACHINES! I wish I loved closer!
Had high expectations but they fell off the table. Meat had no juice left over after the grill - perhaps they use a low fat beef (I dunno). Great staff. Great service. Mediocre burger. I had the Ronnie with cheese.

ChIJh8S3aVJxj1QR1Fc9otI_Y1g,Thai Lemongrass Restaurant,4.2,48.461517,-123.2973538,499,"Finally found the best Thai Food in Victoria. Made a reservation for 4:15 to avoid the dinner rush. Service was top notch and the the food did not disappoint. From the first sip of my Tom Ka Gai soup I knew I had finally found the quality authentic Thai I have been looking for. I‚Äôll be back with more friends next time.
These guys are the real deal! I sat down and felt cared for. The whole meal the front of house staff were literally running back and forth to get everyone taken care of on a busy Friday night. Major props to those guys. There‚Äôs absolutely no doubt that they‚Äôre working hard. I even saw one of the servers take the time to work through a customer speaking in a language he didn‚Äôt understand. He was patient, kind and took the time to take great care of the customer despite the fact that it took him away from his duties to other customers. I have absolutely no problem waiting a few extra minutes for service like this.

The food was also fantastic. I ordered a pineapple fried rice and it was something completely new to me. The portion sizes were very generous and I left feeling the way one should feel walking out of a restaurant. Satisfied but wanting to taste more! Nowadays companies are doing everything they can to limit portion sizes and increase prices, Lemongrass did not meet this stereotype, they gave me a generous portion that left me satisfied with the price I paid. The dish also tasted absolutely amazing. 10/10 cannot wait to come back and try another dish. Bravo!
I ordered takeout here for the first time, took an hour which was fine, I showed up on time, there was only one line for dining in or picking up. After a few minutes, I told the hostess I was here for pickup and she said to go back in line. After another 5 minutes or so, she asked my name and got our food, which was very good.
I don't think I will ever go here or get takeout again.
We came on a Thursday at around 4:00 pm. I had read multiple reviews where they said the service was slow etc. So I had prepared myself in advance for this and to my surprise it was not slow at all. But that's probably because the restaurant was empty at 4 and there was no one here but us. The food came out really fast and the servers were really attentive. They gave out new plates for appetizers, mains and desserts. They weren't over bearing but when asking for the bill and to order it might be a bit difficult depending on where you are sitting in the restaurant but that's just my take. On to the food!

Por pia -$10 - 4 spring rolls with a sweet and sour sauce. Very crispy. Lots of cabbage inside. Not overly salty

Prawn Pad Thai - $15.50 - big portion. I liked the proportion of fresh bean sprouts and peanuts to noodles. There were around 7-8 big shrimps which was very generous for the price. The noodles were nicely cooked. A lot of places that have pad Thai always overcook their noodles and they break easily but here they are still intact long noodles. They are bouncy and have a good chew to then. Not overly sweet or salty. Nicely seasoned and not too oily.

Vegetable green curry - $14.95 - lots of veggies - green peppers, bamboo shoots, carrots etc. The curry itself was really flavourful. Hint of lemongrass. Went so well with just plain rice. I could eat lots of rice with this dish (maybe 3 bowls haha)

Drunken chicken noodles - $14.50 - big portion. Very strong basil flavour overall which I really liked. The noodles were again nicely cooked. Good amount of chicken. Would definitely order it again.

Deep fried banana with ice cream - $5.50 - not too sweet. The batter was nice and thin and crispy. Good way to end the night.

Overall I would recommend this place for Thai food. The interior feels very homey and the service is pretty good. The portions are good enough to feed a couple people and the flavours are pretty good. The prices are also reasonable for the amount of food you get.

TIP: order their drunken noodles
Amazing food! Even better service! I ordered the red curry lunch combo, extra hot. It was perfect in every way, with enough food to take for a snack later. I loved it! They gave great beer as well. The staff was super attentive, but never overwhelming. The washroom was clean. The atmosphere is inviting and the location could not be better, within walking distance of the beach. I love this place and will be back!

The place has a fairly cozy atmosphere and fair portion sizes, hands down the papaya salad was the best thing we had. It's been ages since we've had a good papaya salad with a proper spice to it. Martini was a touch bit on the strong side and don't bother with the coffee if you're looking for a caffeine slap. Overall will definitely be returning next time I'm in town!

Not really traditional Thai food, way too sweet in every dish
Wow. This is an amazing place to go! I have been to this Baan Thai location a multitude of times. It is an understatement to say that I highly recommend this place. For anyone who enjoys quality Thai food and great service, this is the place to be.

Great place for some great tacos üåÆ üòã We have dined here several times now, and as of late, for the Happy Hour menu. Tacos are big and filling and priced well. They are well presented and put together. We had the Fish, Cauliflower, Carnita and Bean tacos, delightful. The Guacamole and chips are yummy too, the chips are nice and crunchy with the right amount of seasoning. Definitely recommend. It's our favorite place for tacos any day of the week üòã
Aye yaye yaye! Lunch was everything we could ask for. Fast service and really yummy meals. We had the fried chicken burrito, fish baja tacos, beef burrito and of course the very tasty and chilled Miss Hibiscus Margarita. Definitely coming back to try more tacos and special drinks!
Don‚Äôt say you serve signature homemade guacamole when it‚Äôs clearly packaged. It was whipped and had a weird texture like the stuff you get out of bags. It was unappetizing. Ordered 4 tacos and they were all soggy and had hardly any filling. I absolutely love Mexican food and am shocked that this place is so popular. Had really high hopes. Not to mention service was sooooo slow, took them 20 minutes just to take our order.
In and out quick for our first try at La Taqueria.  The space is pretty cool with the exposed beams and venting overhead, the bar and kitchen being in the middle of the restaurant is also nice.  Staff were super friendly and pleasant especially our server.  My daughter and I had a taco each, she had the al pastor and I the carnitas, both on corn tortillas.
I love that they used both a yellow and a blue corn tortillas and were warmed nice and soft but cooked.
The carnitas were quite nice.  Nice balance of flavours although as a personal preference I wanted a little more crackling/fat to lean meat ratio.  All three hot sauces(not pictured)  were their own flavour profiles and heat levels so that was A+.
The pastor for my daughter, she said was ‚Äúok‚Äù, she rates it a 3.5 stars as she was looking for that nicely shaven/char from the meat that‚Äôs cooked nicely on the spit and she feels she didn‚Äôt get that.  (She‚Äôs had a lot of Al Pastor at different taco stands in Mexico last year, so I feel it‚Äôs a fair opinion). The pineapple salsa was a bit much for her in terms of ratio with the meat so she took some off which I ate and I quite liked them actually.
Cannot wait to come back to try everything.

Incredible Italian food with large portions and super friendly staff. Really fun atmosphere inside as well. Easily the best meal we had during our trip to Victoria.

The food was pretty good, drinks were good too.  I ordered a cocktail I didn't like and they happily exchanged it for another.  The atmosphere and service were awesome.  Great job The Mint team with Ok, Dope.
Really nice ambience and lovely vibe. Especially love the convenience of the location and characterful entrance! Nonetheless, nothing stood out to me when it came to food or drinks. Quite overpriced for what it turned out to be, in my opinion. But kuddos to the lovely staff who work here who were nothing but kind to us!
I recently dined at The Mint in downtown Victoria and I must say, I was thoroughly impressed! The guest skills of the staff were exceptional and made me feel welcome and appreciated from the moment I walked in. üëçüëè

As for the food, I highly recommend the tofu dish - it was simply delicious! üå±üç≤ The dish was perfectly cooked and had a nice blend of flavors that left me wanting more. The chef truly knows how to work their magic in the kitchen. ü§§

The ambiance of the restaurant is also worth mentioning - it was cozy, warm, and inviting, making it the perfect spot for a night out with friends or a romantic dinner. üïØÔ∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

Overall, I highly recommend The Mint to anyone looking for an exceptional dining experience in downtown Victoria. With friendly and attentive guest skills and mouth-watering dishes like the tofu, it's a must-visit destination for foodies and those seeking a memorable night out. üçΩÔ∏èüëå
Knew this place since its opening way back when as it took over the spot of one of my former favorite teenage stomping grounds (Victoria Underground Onramp Cybercaf√©) but never really had the chance to go in. I made an exception since I saw the sign for their appy hour which is 17:00-19:00 which is refreshingly late considering how I rush out after work to downtown and usually miss it with the bus commute.

The double mojito & the chicken poutine are okay, but the momos are amazing. I was recommended chicken which I had but the pork ones taste the best. I like the ambiance and I do see some areas where I do remembered the old days.

Perhaps someone should start up old meets from decades past in here. I wouldn't mind having some nostalgia resurfacing in this joint. The bartender's real sweet so don't be shy and go for the bar seating.
Imagine this: it's a Friday night at 11pm - and as much as Victoria is a cute town, there really isn't that many places to get any food late night that isn't fast food or pizza.

Enter The Mint. A full curry menu through late night!! Incredible. Ordered the lamb curry plate and it was delicious.

I had the lamb chops medium rare and they were the best tasting lamb chops I've EVER had!!! The cook and the seasoning were absolute perfection. We shared the flaming mozzarella for an app that was truly delicious. I would highly recommend eating here. You won't be disappointed....I promise!
It‚Äôs so beautiful there, really friendly and disciplined staff. The chicken souvlaki was great. Lamb shank was a over priced. Three star because the potatoes were super salty, a pinch of salt is understandable but this much of salt was a surprise for such a well rated restaurant. I had a good experience because it represents Greece but probably not the best choice of food for a Greek restaurant. They can do better on the dishes for such a great place, but the tase was not extraordinary.

The menu was printed on regular piece of paper by a default font Microsoft word, absolute minimum effort, really?! It needs a better one.
Excellent food. Just as good if not better in some cases than what I had in Greece. Service was very good too. Attentive. However it was a bit puzzling that they changed our waiter after we ordered without informing us...
Quaint decor, and lots of seating.  The food was better than expected, and the Greek ribs and ekmek were excellent, fresh and tasty (ekmek is really hard to get right).  The service was friendly, welcoming and efficient (no wait without a reservation tonight at 6-ish).  Our server John was pleasant, attentive, light-hearted, and helpful.  All in all, surprisingly good Greek food experience.

My friends took me there to celebrate my 41 b-day. üòÄ The ambiance is so welcoming and the server, Dimitri (hopefully I'm not wrong), so friendly, chatty, welcoming and professional. My friends and i had chicken soup, saganaki flamb√©e, and ""Appetizer for 2"" platter. Although it says for two people it was big enough to feed the three of us.

Brussel sprouts were way undercooked, mashed potatoes were really salty. Mac and cheese is incredible, though - you can add chicken, broccoli, etc for an extra charge. Our server was nice, but only visited the tables on each side of us (not ours) in the last 20 minutes, so it took a long time to get our check. We never got a refill on water either, but maybe they figured the bottle of wine was adequate for us üòâ Be aware that there's a game room with pool etc, sports games on TV, so it can get a little loud if you're seated near it. Main dining room is relatively quiet otherwise, or it was when we went. Basically the food is good, service is alright, and they have a rooftop patio that looks great. The food was good enough that I'd give it another chance when I'm in town. It wasn't particularly busy, but maybe our server had more tables in another room that kept her busier than we were aware of?
Old world charm meats big screen TV's.
Nice selection of both import and local brewery beer. I went with the wicket lager, it's brewed by Vancouver island brewery.
Menu is not overwhelming and it's easy to find something you want to try. Whether it be bangers and Mash, a burger or even mac and cheese.
The food is seasoned well and decent portions.
Staff were all welcoming and friendly.  We did find that one gentleman who brought the food to the table wore entirely too much cologne. It was to the point I would sneeze every time he walked past us.
Perhaps businesses need to bring back the no scent atmosphere for their customers convenience.
We will return.
Import beer is pricey
Cool atmosphere. We were visiting Victoria and stopped in for some drinks and food. First place that asked us for two IDs, which is apparently a practice in BC..found that interesting and had to go back to our hotel to grab it. When we got in and saw how big the place was, it made a bit more sense to us!

I wish I could remember our servers name, he was fairly new to Victoria - recently moved from Calgary. He was great - super friendly and attentive.

The food was pretty good as well. Had the chicken quesadillas, Caesar salad and hubby got the jambalaya. Would definitely recommend checking this place out!
Wish there were more vegetarian/vegan options, but for a traditional pub it was great! I had the Baha bowl with tofu and it was great. My friend had the bangers and mash and said it was ok.
Our yearly tradition to visit while dine around is on. Have had some truly incredible experiences in past years.

This year was disappointing. Specifically:
1. Appy: spouse got the Brussels which was a good sized portion but they must have added two much lemon or something making it sour. The soup I got in comparison was tiny, but tasty.

2. Main course: spouse got steak and lobster. Although steak was medium rare it was tough and difficult to cut.

3. Service: We ran out of water in the small glasses of water they provide during our appy and was never offered a refill. The appy came relatively quickly but the gap between finishing appy before main and main to dessert was significant.

Will likely return again to give them another chance next year, but do recommend giving them a miss for the 2023 dine around.

Wonderful meal ... AGAIN!! The selections are always tasty and well presented.  Never disappointed and we were happy to bring two couples with us this time. The ""first-timers"" were as impressed with their selections as well.  There is an accessible washroom (single room) which I believe is part of the hotel.  Unfortunately, there are a few things that need to be improved to make it friendlier.  The hook mounted on the door is too high for someone in a wheelchair as is the towel dispenser which requires hand motion to activate it.  These things could be easily fixed by adding a lower coat hook and lowering the towel dispenser.  The room is a good size and the there is an assist bar mounted beside the toilet.
LOVE going to the Bar 500 for jazz nights. Its a cozy atmosphere and not too crowded. The menu is small and the food is delicious. Our only request/recommendation is to add a few monthly dining features to change things up a bit. We would come more often then. All in All, a GREAT venue.
We visited in the evening for the Dine around town menu.  The mushroom chowder was amazing and creamy.  We had the sablefish entree which consisted of outstanding different flavours.  I hope they consider adding the sablefish dinner to their permanent menu.
I got super sick after eating there last weekend. Would appreciate to be contacted by management for a refund. The minimum, after I spending 6 miserable days and counting battling fever and aches. Please tell your male clerk who was working the weekend brunch shift to not scratch his face while he puts away the ""clean"" cluttery. That is not food safe! And for him to be gentle and not make so much noise, throwing them in the bins. He is not at his home.

The music is subtle (but good),the staff are lovely, and the food is excellent. Plus the menu is mostly sourced from ingredients local to the island.

One Cool thing about The Drake Eatery:

If chess is your thing, then I'd recommend you hit this spot with your favorite set and play buddy. It's not like tournaments happen here or anything like that. I just saw a pair playing when I was there and it just seemed like they were having a really good time.
My first impression was the bar is well put together and atmosphere was awesome for downtown Victoria. I enjoy the somewhat open kitchen concept. You have to come up to the bar to order your food. The food is a hit/miss, the potatoes was a 3/10 very dilly. The Beef Tongue Reuben was a 7.7/10. First time trying beef tongue so it was good. The craft beer I ordered was okay. After you order your food, they don‚Äôt really check up on you and ask if you need anything else.
I sat in the beer garden area. The beer garden has a smaller food and drink menu than the eatery which is located upstairs. Not sure why? They had a gluten free beer option on the upstairs menu but no option for the beer garden. Service was only bar service and it was slow.
The food itself was really good. Ordered the fish tacos and roast beef sandwich. Lots of seating in a nice open space.
The Flensburger dunkle dark lager was very good. The cider was too hoppy for me I prefer a slightly sweeter cider. It tasted like grapefruit juice.
You serve yourself at the bar then take it outside.
Great selection of beers; interesting menu and some wonderful selections. The grilled cheese with kimchi is a favourite. The nitro porter was one of the most enjoyable beers I‚Äôve had on tap. ‚Ä¶ came back again for my birthday; same positives and staff was awesome in accommodating a cake brought for me. Excellent atmosphere.

Gosh! I tell you their spaghetti is awesome. I don‚Äôt take a picture of my food but, because I was so starving that evening so, I forgot to take some pictures. Everything was absolutely delicious and amazing supper. Their warm bread with whipped garlic butter were top notch! Keep asking them to refill and they bring it up on the table. Always make reservation before otherwise you will be waiting for a long time to get your table. And because they are busy, just be patience and be kind to the waitress. They serve you really well.

ChIJyaZt6490j1QRAcyFr6jyLns,Chorizo & Co. Restaurant & Bar,4.7,48.4241518,-123.3620638,371,"We enjoyed our dinner at chorizo and co. Calamari as appetizer were tasty with fresh ingredients. We had to order some extra bread.
We then ordered the large paella and the plate was huge. It was topped with large amount of fresh fish and calamari steak, very nicely seared. The paella dish was a bit wet (too much sauce) but we enjoyed it. We had no stomach left for dessert... Maybe next time!
We hit upon Chorizo & Co. when the place where we intended to eat was closed.  What a happy circumstance!  The food was delicious.  Shared the Mediterranean platter with a friend - best hummus I‚Äôve ever tasted, and the grilled pita was delicious.  Our companions were also very happy with their corn dog and specialty burger.  Would definitely eat here again.
One of the top restaurants in Victoria! Unique menu with amazingly perfect flavor profiles. Great for a special date night or just a a casual dinner out. The staff are very friendly and very knowledgeable with food and wine pairings. 100% recommend - it is definitely my go to spot to impress friends and family!
OVERALL:  Nice place with a great atmosphere. Not a great price / value ratio - Good Menu but  needs to improve the dishes. Realistically this place is somewhere between very good 3 stars and bad 4 stars.
DETAILED REVIEW:  Drinks were good and the service solid (Local Draft beers and an OK wine selection). The food was a disappointment unfortunately - we had high hopes. We had the croquettes (these are OK, these tasted too much  bbq sauce), cabbage rolls (good dish, but not cooked properly, the cabbage was still a little uncooked, and not soft), calamari starter (interesting BBQ flavour, ok but not convincing ) -  the paella (large hopes and biggest disappointment. Dish was super salty, the mix of seafood didn‚Äôt seem right - it came with broiled fish and grilled calamari steak on top - in a nutshell just weird and not well balanced) + we finished with a grilled foie gras (not great, somehow not a fresh and good flavour + too pricey).
Spanish tapas influenced menu. We enjoyed the olives served with charred grilled bread to start. The paella was very nice, especially the Humboldt squid which was so tender and the salt cod which was fried crispy. Prices are on the higher side, but dishes seem to use quality ingredients.

The service was very good and the guy taking our order was very nice, but the food was disappointing. The noodles were dry and the chicken chop suey soup was not flavorful. The sweet and sour pork was the only thing that saved the meal. Unfortunately will not be coming back.
Great family restaurant and Victoria's best kept secret and hidden jem. Been going there since 2016 when I visit Victoria. Staff are friendly and serve huge portions. Delivery driver the other night when I had arrived in Victoria and checked in to the hotel was friendly and professional just like at the restaurant.
Ordered vegetable chowmein and was slightly disappointed. I'll start with the good which was portion size. I got a lot of food for the money and feel it was worth it from a value perspective.

For the bad, the chowmein was drowned in a soupy sauce that made it soggy and wet which I was not a fan of. Secondly, while I appreciated the amount of vegetables there were way to many. It was like 60% vegetables and 40% noodles. I prefer a higher noodle ratio because that is what I enjoy eating. In the photo I removed the vegetables so you can see just how many noodles are actually left.

Flavor wise, it was ok... nothing to write home about. Nothing special and I kept having to get past the ""soupyness"". If I was in Victoria again I'd probably try elsewhere.
I'd been looking for a Chinese food place to order from since I moved out to Vic for School, and Young's has hit home every time! The food really is good, and the owner is always so kind and passionate over the phone. I agree with some of the other reviews that I wish there was a menu update, as I'd love to be able to order dumplings haha, but its not a big deal. (Also I actually enjoy the spring rolls, they're crunchy and filled with cabbage)

I hope to go in to eat once the pandemic is over, but for now I'll settle for ordering Chinese food when I don't feel like doing my meal prep. It really is a treat to order from here.
The service was very good, this was our first visit and we enjoyed the experience. I was disappointed that we could not get wine with our meal, but that is a minor issue. The war wonton was awesome.

ChIJeVwsJYB0j1QRn7FdyRpPUp8,Wendy's,3.3,48.4358351,-123.3631557,1241,"Edit: The service here is ABYSMAL. Dude only filled my chili cup half way, after I had to remind them about it because they didn't put it in my bag. Had to ask for hot sauce and crackers too. I understand that fast food is the bottom of the barrel for jobs, but it's incredible how incompetent some people can be.

If there is more than one person in line, don't expect to get your food for at least 10-15 minutes. Almost as slow as the Pandora Mcdons, which is saying something. Food is good, but holy smokes the staff are slllllllloooooooooooooooooow.
I was crew on opening day for this location back in 2002. (I think that was the year) anyway.. the process has changed so much that the food prep is not the same. The quality coming from this location has been consistently poor. When I asked for a fresh crispy chicken, you know.. the nice crispy ones? Yeah, I got the chicken that expired in the draw of shame. It was nasty.

The meat used to be hand laid and pressed (4 corner press) and now they use the clamp method of cooking in masses and it doesn't have the same level of care. Nor did it speed up the process.

I used to love Wendy's when quality was actually their recipe....
Vegetable and meat are fresh and bigger than McDonald's. I ordered spicy chicken combo with poutines for $2+. The poutine has bacon ü•ì and tastes good. You should try spicy chicken when you come. Recommendation!
Cashier was very friendly attentive and professional but the kitchen staff was not speaking English and was really inappropriate lacking care and rough when placing food on tray or bags.

If you order from the app definitely be prepared to wait and pay more than in store that is crazy not just 10% but like a small frosty over a dollar, similar with other items.

They have a free coffee offer but make sure you ask for cream and or sugar if you want as there is none where the condiments are placed and if take out well tough luck no ketchup or sauces or even napkins !

Baked potato was ok but the middle was not fully cooked the cheese was drenched and sloppy, the burger for take out was literally falling apart not sure if because the way bag was dumped on counter etc...

Please note you will need to wipe tables as they very sticky and lots were not even cleaned off when it was slow maybe three customers dining.  The bathroom garbage was over filled and general touch up not even able to give them a pass water on the floor, might be the fault of customers but trash don't tell me it all within a four hours of a shift and there was no soap.

Only giving two stars because of the cashier seemed like she had some passion to be at work, was friendly, patient, and for the ample free parking as well as the coffee which surprisingly was good
This location is in need of some serious help, they might need to bring in people from head office or something üòÇ line up is always wrapped around the building and inside is a nightmare. Showed up at 10:15am and I was told they had no more eggs, sausage or biscuits for breakfast. Breakfast is over before 11am? Then I went to order lunch and they said chicken would be a 10 minute wait, so what do they have? Figure it out guys. It wasn‚Äôt even lunch yet and they were already struggling. Victoria needs another location to take some of the pressure off of this location.

I just wanted to say thank you to the staff at white spot. We took my elderly parents out for brunch, and the staff was very accommodating to    My dad‚Äôs wheelchair and speech issues.   Which helped turn a normal day into a memorable day.   The food was delicious and very filling.

Thank you
White Spot used to be the best. Now they‚Äôre just average. Had a burger and fries. The fries were stone cold as was the bun. The meat patty was burnt, actually crunchy. No amount of triple o could improve that. Excellent service though.
We came in Sat June 24th just after 11am. Five of us were seated immediately. Our server Tyrus was excellent! Very attentive, funny, patient and kind. I have worked in restaurants for 30 years and would have loved to work alongside Tyrus.  The whole team was friendly. And they had the sweetest  busser ever! He made sure my sisters coffee was always topped up! My GF burger and fries was delicious. All the food was. Thank you for a fabulous meal! Sorry we spilled the whole container of cream within the first 2 min of being there haha ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
In the past 2 months, I‚Äôve ordered the double burger with a gluten free bun twice, and I‚Äôve been disappointed each time.. it just didn‚Äôt taste good. I wish I had more constructive criticism, and hate giving less than 4 stars. I ordered it a second time hoping it would be better, and came back because my friend loves the teriyaki rice bowl. At least the fries were decent!

I‚Äôll update this rating if I go back and another item is more appetizing, it might be just the gluten free bun and the cheap pre-sliced cheese. Maybe the gluten bun makes it better, I know it‚Äôs hard for restaurants to cater to celiac customers and appreciate their effort.

ChIJgZNsow5zj1QRiwuIBGsvP2I,A&W Canada,3.8,48.4544647,-123.3952547,370,"Made fresh off the grill and bagged appropriately. Slight wait (approximately 5-7 minutes) due to high volume but reasonable considering the full staff were keeping as fast as they could. Most customers who were here with me seem quite satisfied with their orders.

Some of the folks giving poor reviews on Maps seem to lack some common sense and are definitely trolls attributing to the overall great resignation impacting the food service industry. I can understand that service was not optimal at one point but if you check them out lately, they have significantly improved.
Very tasty burger meals- nice date food before we headed to a movie üçø
We had the Uncle Burger and the Mama burger meal. The burger itself was very fresh and juicy to taste!
They left me one Buddy Burger short on my order. I went back the following week and asked for an extra one. They did this without issue. Mistakes happen. I‚Äôm glad I didn‚Äôt have to fight them to make it right. Great service.
I always have to wait 10 mins for the Beyond burger whenever I come here and other restaurants. Thankful for the only vegan choice, but it is frustrating. Anyways thanks for the BYND burger option.
I don't normally go to fastfood but I really love the yam fries in this particular location today. They always make them fresh. Special thanks to Adrian who made the yam fries. Thanks..

ChIJSfbyTJB0j1QRWTqiWMNmH4Q,Vista 18 Restaurant + Lounge,4.1,48.4221151,-123.3646122,552,"Took my best friend here for a birthday breakfast, as his first time at Vista 18. In my reservation I had requested a table overlooking the Inner Harbour if possible, for the special occasion. Upon arrival we were taken to the other side of the restaurant and seated with a less than desirable view of some buildings below. It was slightly busy, but noticed some empty tables as we walked in, so I inquired about a better table as per my online request. Though not a ‚Äòwindow‚Äô seat, our server was able to seat us at an empty elevated booth near the Harbour side of the restaurant, across the aisle from the windows, giving us a view of the ocean! My granola parfait was oddly mostly pineapple chunks, which I left as I dislike them; however, my breakfast potatoes were very good, and my friend enjoyed his benny. Our banana smoothies were also very delicious! Overall, it was a nice breakfast, reasonably priced, and our server was very nice! Would pass on the parfait for next time.

*Note: the empty tables pictured were mostly all occupied when we arrived*
Overall upset about the service. Firstly, despite requesting window seats since booking close to 2 weeks in advance, they could only give us a booth across a walking aisle because the host said they were booked upon arrival. Throughout the meal until the end, I walked around the restaurant for the different views and for the bathroom and no one ever sat at those questionable ""booked"" tables. The view wasn't spectacular either way. The food was not bad as the flavor was on point and portions were as described. However, my $40 steak had over 25% worth of inedible membrane in it and I voiced my disappointment to the server. He was very polite but couldn't offer any good explanation. He mentioned he could get a discount on the bill but never got back to us until I question the bill at the end. Wish they could just offer a small percentage discount or even a small complimentary dessert. That could easily win a five-star. Small offerings to satisfy an upset customer goes a long way. I have been to many similar-level restaurants that could do much better. Quite a bit of improvement in management is needed, including seat allocation.
A convenient downtown Victoria location, with a fantastic 270 degree wrap around view of the inner harbour. The food was excellent and the service staff were professional and very friendly. Made for a memorable dinner with friends.
We had a wonderful dining experience here with great food and service and a fantastic view of the city. We had the fresh Oysters and Humboldt Squid as appetizers. Then the Sesame Tuna and Pork Tenderloin for our main course. Cheesecake and Three Truffles for dessert.
We went in for me and my friends 18th birthday. Amelia was fun, helpful and very knowledgeable about the menu. She did a great job creating a laid back lovely experience. Food was fantastic, views absolutely worth it. Will be back the next time we are in the province!

All appetizers especially the seafood tower were top-notch. Only negative was one of the mains, the Gnocchi ( pictures posted ) it was very, very average at best. Would definitely not order again BUT will definitely be back.
The best place to spectate Victoria harbour. I recommend booking ahead, mind you in my experience they give us 2 hours for our reservation. Lunch is less busy and avoid booking for under 6 heads otherwise you are paying table surcharge). Excellent coffee and dessert selection. Brunch is excellent.
We were out walking, and we stopped in and had matcha lattes. They came in ceramic cups. The atmosphere was modern, and the view is fantastic of the harbor. The bathrooms are beautifully designed. We would love to come back in the future for a happy hour!
Wonderful restaurant on the waterfront with a view from practically everywhere you sit. The service was awesome, the food was delicious, and the atmosphere was relaxing and upbeat.
Oh and the desserts are made in house, which you can also get take out.

ChIJiRrbvJV0j1QRRHnTKnu1_mY,James Bay Inn Restaurant,4.3,48.4153947,-123.3694605,528,"This is one of my favorite spots for dinner when in town.  I‚Äôve tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to find something I didn‚Äôt enjoy.

In addition to the regular menu, they have specials each evening, which typically include a pasta and a main entree.  These can sell out quickly on busy nights.

The Caesar salad is amazing and I always get one!

There are several vegetarian options and the veggie burger is great.

Bar options are limited in the restaurant but you can enjoy beer or wine with your meal.

Service is always friendly and attentive and the atmosphere is cozy.
This is the second time I've stayed here. I love it, the rooms are small and still use the old style hot water heating radiator so if it's cold in there it will take a bit to heat up. There is no AC so I'd expect it can get hot in the summer. The hotel has a colourful history and is over 100 years old. The hallways are adorned with Emily Carr Paintings (she died there) also the hotel supposedly is one of the most haunted in Canada although I haven't experienced anything while there.  The staff is very friendly and helpful. If you're into older style hotels that aren't just another boring place then this place is for you.
Nice old place in the heart of James bay 10 min walk from down town no line up big and roomy  ordered a full candaron breakfast first bite amazing. Tastes like home made bread  vary happy with the size of the breakfast. The service is good. If you like a place for breakfast without a line up  this is your place parking is easy too
Can't say enough great things about this hotel! Immaculately clean. Roy at the desk was a gem. Dinner in the bar was great with friendly conversation, and they accommodated us when we said we needed our breakfast to be quick. Great location to visit the stunning Beacon Hill Park. Rooms are small, but that's to be expected for an historic hotel like this. Highly recommend!
It is not a fancy hotel, but in turn, it feels like an authentic art gallery. The moment you step in, you can feel the good ambiance. Receptionists are super friendly, and room service is flawless. Even the products of high quality.
Pricing is fairly reasonable.
I will definitely choose this place for my future trips to Victoria.

Coming to the Oak Bay Area, this restaurant was recommended both by a tourist website and the front desk at our hotel, so of course we had to stop by. Great service by the staff and delicious food, we could see they were busy but the turnaround time was not bad.

Tried this spot for the first time, food was fantastic and good experience overall.

We went here on a Sunday morning at 9 and there was plenty of tables available.
We were greeted right away and offered water to start.

Once we had our orders placed, it took a bit of time for our food to arrive. There seemed to be two cooks in the kitchen. The food arrived and it was worth the longer wait. It had good flavour and was well presented.

I recommend this as a weekend breakfast spot!
I just had the Avalon Skillet and it was large, delicious and great value. The eggs were well cooked, and tasty. The homemade oat bread was delicious and I loved the strawberry compote thingy to go with it was nice. The potatoes were also nice and crispy. I will come back with friends and family.
My new favourite breakfast place. It‚Äôs a small greasy-spoon style diner, run by a family. The portions are large, the staff are amazingly friendly and the coffee is refillable. It was very busy the day we went and the staff/family was obviously struggling to keep up, but you could tell they were trying their best and everyone waited patiently. All around this place is amazing and I will go back many times.
Fantastic food and service!! Must eat here! Eggs Benny were delicious, pancakes light and fluffy and the skillet was incredibly tasty!! Did I mention the potatoes!?? They have got to be the best and most delicious potatoes ever!! Crispy outside, soft and tender inside, perfectly seasoned!!! Amazing they are all homemade! 10 stars!!

ChIJ7bELJO10j1QRfDlmY2GMJVM,Big Wheel Burger COOK ST,4.4,48.415073,-123.3558604,1479,"It‚Äôs okay.
They are usually busy so that must be good for them, but for me about a 20 minute wait. The quality was 6/10 in my opinion, but the biggest problem are their prices. Paying over $20 for a burger without fries is too high for me. I respect the fact that they are saving the world one wooden fork at a time, but the wait, the quality, and the price of food isn‚Äôt worth it in my opinion.
Would I go back? Probobly not.
The first time I had their double cheeseburger via delivery app, I already became a fan. Here‚Äôs me trying their crispy chicken burger at Cook St.  branch. They have a cool crew as well!
Excellent quality fast food. They give back to the community too. The kids meal rocks ! We split a milkshake and they were kind enough to give us a second up & divide some up so my daughter couldn‚Äôt hog the whole thing üòÇ
Average tasting burger, fries, and shake and WAY too expensive.  $25 for one person. That‚Äôs a hundred bucks for a family of four!  Ludicrous.  I won‚Äôt be eating there again.  Almost forgot to mention they ran out of ketchup. When I asked the staff they said ‚Äúyes, we are out‚Äù but then one of the staff offered me one of the prepared mini take out ketchup cups - which was just great‚Ä¶but it was almost like an afterthought.  You need to do better.
This is a fast food restaurant. That being said, it is in a part of downtown Victoria which is charming and beautiful. Parking is fairly easy to find nearby. There are plenty of shops and interesting spots to check out which you are here.

The menu is a digital board and has an amusing set of cartoonish images it parcels through to keep you entertained while you wait for your food. Your carbonated beverages are in cans and above average taste. The ginger ale is good and is made with real ginger.

The young, redheaded man who worked the counter was very helpful in making sure our food was safe and helping us figure out what to order as first-time customers.

We visited here as they have gluten free buns and poutine. I was very happy to hear they have vegan aioli as well, as I'm allergic to eggs, in addition to gluten and wheat. We ordered two gluten free burgers (one black bean and yam) with bun and a gluten free poutine to share.

We were happy with the quality and amount of cheese on the poutine. The few fries we had, which were dry, were delicious. The gravy is bland and thin. It tastes like someone thickened bargain brand chicken stock and called it gravy. Because it was so thin, it sunk to the bottom of the fries, making all the fried potatoes on the bottoms gross mush. We both agreed we would not order this again, but we would order a plain fry.

That said, the gluten free buns were so like gluten buns in appearance, taste and texture, I went to ask if our order was really gluten free. I will be sick for months if I ingest gluten, so I needed to be sure. He said they have a local bakery make them just for this chain. All I have to say is the other eateries in the area need their number, because they were all the lumpy, dense, powdering gunk I sadly receive most of the time. The kitchen cut each the burger burger and the black bean burger in half, as we both wanted to try them. We swapped half of each and agreed the black bean and yam is in the top two for best black bean burgers we've ever had. The beans were not sandy mush, as so many are. They had texture and some light crunch on the outside edges. I happily finished my two half burgers and nibbled some of the fries.

The seating is all typical, bright hue plastic. The tables are laminate. The indoor seating area was on the small side, but there is a beautiful park nearby that would make a for a wonderful setting to eat in. I couldn't help but notice the floor and all the tables were littered with food and pieces of food packaging. I hope we came at the end of a rush and they hadn't had a chance to clean it up.

Overall, I would return again for the burgers, a very good ginger ale and a fry.

Another lovely Bubby's location! I tried the mediterranean omelette which was absolutely fantastic. Good portion size and very tasty. Everyone was super friendly and helpful. Would definitely recommend sitting here and having a coffee.
A bright, wide, beautiful scene with delicious early morning breakfast. Decorative, there's always something new to look at when you turn your head. The latte is tasty and the service is kindly. They carry vegan and gluten-free items. Teas and matcha are locally supplied.
This beautiful space was exactly what we needed for a low key and delicious lunch. Their signature chocolate cookie was so so good and I very much enjoyed the sandwich I got. When I'm back in the area I will absolutely come back.

Beets, buttermilk fried oysters and grilled squid were the highlight dishes. Only downside was the rice/paella dish which was disappointing as the rice seemed somehow both gluggy and undercooked at the same time. Would still recommend it as a nice seafood dining experience.
Had the salmon.  Wonderfully prepared, especially the crust.  Crispy.  Amazing balance of flavors with their choice of greens.  Server recommended the perfect wine to complement.  Just a beautiful, overall dining experience. Casually refined., calm and never felt rushed.  Also love the decor and Service was excellent!
Loved the food, especially scallops and bouillabaisse. Oysters are fresh, but smaller than what served up the island. Overall, very happy with the experience.

The staff was very nice to us.
Love their seafood linguine! The seasoning is  savoury and seafood is fresh. The clam chowder is a little bit saltier than expected but the portion is definitely XXL, good for 2 ppl.
The food was delicious. The service was fantastic. The prices were fair for what we got. The ambience is cute. Make a reservation if you can just in case there is a wait. Would come here again if we're feeling some yummy seafood.

ChIJf9Onuo90j1QRtc5oTWJSnYE,Sookjai Thai Restaurant,4.6,48.423945,-123.360187,730,"This is really good Thai food for a fair price in the center of Victoria BC!
If you like Thai food?
This is the place to be!
Great service, excellent food, good price and delicious flavours.
Sookie always welcomes you with a smile.

There is a lot of choice.
And they also have their own spicy pepper sauce for 12,50.
Try it and buy it!
You can find it also in stores in Victoria.
The best!!
We ordered 5 dishes, they looked great but all were too salty for us. But I love the atmosphere here.
Good food and amazing service, they‚Äôre super nice. If you like spice but aren‚Äôt a spice hound I would say ‚Äúthai hot‚Äù is perfect for the pad thai and ‚Äúhot‚Äù for the curries since they tend to be a bit spicier. Definitely recommend the mango and sticky rice, it‚Äôs made with black rice which is hard to find in a lot of places.
I think the prices are a little steep but not crazy especially for downtown.
Wow!! Amazing quality of food and a really exotic palette of flavors‚Ä¶ Thai food this good is hard to come by. Truly artesanal in craftsmanship both visually and in taste. Also, plentiful serving sizes!

The servers were nothing but friendly and had wonderful suggestions. The only complaint I had was that with menu offerings at these prices, it seems a bit gimmicky to charge extra for things like plain rice‚Ä¶ while I understand charging for it, I think it should come with the larger curry dishes, especially considering the already steep pricing.

Nonetheless, a really memorable restaurant experience and this place is often packed to the tee - expect a long wait and come hungry!
Really good service to start, i really appreciate it!
I was disappointed about the starters ( fish balls, spring roll and banana roll) . It was more like what you can find in a cheap buffet so i would try a salad as a starter next time.
We had a hot crying tiger ( a bit overcooked but nothing too crazy) , a hot chicken green curry, deep fried pork ( this one was dry but really tasty) and a red chicken curry with coconut rice on side as main courses
I was really suprised by the size and we brought leftovers home. It was really good so it kinda balance with those bad starters
I would love to had some green onions, cilantro and lime on the table for toppings .
Cocktails are really good and you can have a nice bottle of cab sav for 20 $ wich is great as well.
We appreciate the experience and with some changes, especially on the starters side i would definitely put 5 stars!

ChIJW3dgD0F0j1QRvbo0aoM6woE,The Oaks Restaurant and Tearoom,4.3,48.4265983,-123.3142145,425,"Love this place. We have been twice in our first four days here on the island. Friday night for fish and chips and French onion soup, then on Monday for Full Tea and the Original Burger and fries. The place is a nice old fashioned pub, with a white exterior and large black beams. Inside is full of great old tables and chairs.
Our food was wonderful every time we went.
I had been looking for a place with the English pub feeling and Afternoon Tea at a fair price. They have several Tea choices, full tea was only $28!
This is a very unique place! Oldest building in Oak Bay. A YUGE menu, which can be daunting to get through, but everything we had was quite tasty! Fair prices, electric crowd, warm service. More than meets the eye!
The interior is warm but if you are coming here for good service or good food..... GO ELSEWHERE!!
We waited for over 10 minutes before a waitress came to our table. She was rude, not helpful and dismissive. When we finally got our meal she forgot the cream for my tea and although I reminded her she didn't bring it. I finally asked another woman if I could have some.
I also asked 3 times for the jam I had told her I wanted when I gave her my original order. Although she said yes twice, it never appeared. One of the worst breakfasts I've had and the Welsh rarebit that my partner had was not edible. After all this when we asked for the check she didn't bring it. We finally went to the bar to pay it. Needless to say with no tip, which rarely happens with us. We are 20% tippers.
I would never eat here again......nor should you üòÇ
That his our first visit since it had been the Blethering Place! We came for afternoon tea which was quite enjoyable. The wait staff were very efficient and also quite casual. It wasn‚Äôt bad at all, just not the tearoom experience we were expecting. It felt a bit like having afternoon tea in a snug, pub or bar.
The high-tea itself is probably only worth three stars; although that is reflected in the price of the tea. It was cute and decent enough, but definitely not up to English standards. It still made for a fun afternoon.

The restaurant was busy and clean. The staff was very friendly.

My experience was that great. It comes at a cost but the expense is well worth it if you're looking for a new place to try and have a good budget. Fancy date for a seafood lover? I GOT YOUR CHOICE RIGHT HERE. THIS IS THE PLACE.

The food - I love seafood so much. Their oyster flight trio was such an adventure for my taste buds. All the dishes we had looked great, they tasted fantastic, even microwaved the following morning was a revisit to the night before in my mind.

The service - amazing, efficient, well spaced visits, well dressed and well mannered. It was almost like they had perfected their craft in addition to seeming properly staffed.

The atmosphere - low light, music selection is very solid, knew more than a few of the songs and the volume was perfect, it was a narrow path with a cramped feeling but I feel that adds to the charm of the establishment.

My dishes tasted - Single Oyster raw, Trio Oyster sampler, Seafood Chowder, Seafood Laska, Dry Apple Cider.
Amazingly delicious! We had the most romantic dinner and every bite of it was fantastic. Dim lights, great service and beautiful decoration. We had the most perfect hummus, and the short ribs‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll never forget! Thank you for a lovely evening.
We decided to do a wine tasting and oyster experience. 2 Dozen oysters and tasting 3 wines. It was fantastic! Oysters were Fanny Bay, and amazing (Go easy on the Horseradish). I know  red wines were a stretch, but that is why we did it! The mission Hill Happy Hour special, seemed to hold up the best. Happy Hour was just that! One of our best outings!
Trendy seafood restaurant with a great beer selection. I found the food overall pretty good, but seemed to lack a little extra....something. for example, the bouillabaise had a decent amount of seafood, but needed some wine or even a touch of curry. The brownie is huge and rich, but would have been actually better if a little smaller and maybe a bit of vanilla Gelato to temper the excessive super chocolate sweetness a tad and balance it with some creaminess. Service was stellar and loved a number of the beers.
Had a bad experience tonight: ordered a dozen oysters; one smelled and tasted off. Showed it to server. Other server brought two more oysters - not really the issue. Mains we‚Äôre pretty good (fingerling potatoes in the halibut dish were basically raw, but otherwise). Then rather than asking us, the chef sent a desert as apology. We explained that I was a diabetic and my partner allergic to the ground cherries covering the desert. So when we got the bill we expected something to be adjusted. Nope. Full price for everything. Very disappointing. Hoping I don‚Äôt have a bad night ü§¢

ChIJBZnqb4V0j1QRvy29ThYWkmI,Cenote Restaurant and Lounge,4.5,48.426229,-123.362843,499,"The house salad was under-dressed/dry with little flavour. The baked brie, bread, jam, olives and roasted garlic was all delicious but wasn‚Äôt exactly made to be eaten together.

Appreciated the gluten free bread option but likely wouldn‚Äôt go back.
Really unfortunate the management now is behaving like such a rude individual. I loved all of my previous experiences, always good times. However seems something has changed???
Most unpleasant interaction with some form of management attempting to make his opinion known about his burned nachos being how we should enjoy them. Wow. I‚Äôve always enjoyed their nachos- but burning the top and nothing even melted underneath seems to be the new norm?? Hope not‚úåüèª
Proceed with caution ‚ö†Ô∏è

This is a fabulous hole in the wall for small plates to share and unique drink specials. My favorite lately is their double gin and tonic (especially happy hour). Good non-alcoholic options available too!
Pretty cool selection of crafted cocktails. Worth the $$$. Food is ok. The groove is very different. If you haven't been, you should definitely give it a go. It may become your new ""Go TO"" place in Victoria. I'll be back!
Cozy little bar tucked away under the stairs in the heart of downtown. tasty cocktails and great atmosphere. Jess was our server and she went above and beyond to make sure we're having a great time. Great place for a date or to catch up with a friend.

ChIJlXglubh1j1QR1pavRMwq3-w,Nowhere *A Restaurant,4.6,48.4241086,-123.3650299,218,"The good: nicely presented dishes and friendly staff, and a few very nice wines as part of the pairing option for the tasting menu. Generous desert portion and fun conversation with the servers, who also seem to be the cooks. Many nice touches‚Äîfried garlic and ginger and chili flakes on the fried chicken, for instance. Lots of variety in flavors throughout the meal‚Äîmiddle eastern, Caribbean, French, Asian, etc. all contributed.

The bad: the food itself was just ok. The service was good, but the food was slow‚Äîwe were waiting long enough between courses that we were starting to doze off at the table.

There were distracting and/or weird aspects of most of the dishes. We really liked the flavor of the mushroom dish‚Äîfried king oyster slices on a bed of pur√©ed cauliflower with coffee and chocolate with a very nice veggie demiglace‚Äîbut the actual mushrooms themselves were stringy and tough. The smoked fish with veggies marinated in shrimp paste was interesting, but overly heavy and salty‚Äîbright pickled cucumbers helped but weren‚Äôt enough to overcome the heaviness and muddled flavors. The beef tenderloin had great flavor, but also had a big chunk of sinew down the side which made for a very chewy experience.

The wines, overall, were mostly fun and nicely varied. But, they leaned a little heavily toward the funky/weird side, which got a little tiring later in the meal.

Overall, I wouldn‚Äôt say it was a bad meal, but for the price (and based on the other reviews) I was disappointed. Most high end tasting menu experiences I‚Äôve had at this price point have been better.
I had an absolutely amazing experience at Nowhere, a hidden gem of a restaurant that truly exceeded all of my expectations. Despite the fact that you don't get to choose your dishes in the 5 course tasting menu, the restaurant happily accommodated our dietary restrictions without any issues.

What really stood out to me was the freshness and quality of the ingredients. Every dish was expertly prepared and beautifully presented, with a real emphasis on creative flavor combinations and unexpected twists. I was particularly thrilled to see that the chefs added their own unique Filipino accents to several dishes - a truly special touch.

The restaurant itself has a simple and understated decor, with no loud decorations or gimmicks - the focus is very much on the food. Each table was thoughtfully set up for maximum comfort and coziness. The staff was incredibly knowledgeable and attentive, with our servers Jona and Keith going above and beyond to ensure that every aspect of the experience was absolutely perfect. Thank you.

I celebrated my birthday at Nowhere, and it was honestly one of the most memorable meals of my life. I couldn't recommend this restaurant more highly - if you're looking for inventive, delicious cuisine prepared with care and attention to detail, Nowhere is absolutely the place to go.
We had a fantastic experience here with an amazing 6-courses meal and wine pairing.

Each course uses fresh local ingredients to the maximum extent and is presented in an extremely creative way. The wine pairing also matches the meal very well, maximizing the deliciousness of the ingredients.

The owners explained the ingredients, origin and taste of each dish in detail for us. The owners also detail the origin and distillery for each drink, as well as describe its taste and why each wine matches the meal.

Every course is very delicious, the dining experience is extremely great, highly recommended!
After many months of waiting, it is finally our turn! This place is worth the wait! Nowhere A Restaurant offers impeccable service! This YAM 2022 award restaurant gives a simple, rustic, and imaginative atmosphere and chef Clark Deutscher is such a talented and optimistic person! The experience is an unpredictable multi-course mystery menu is quite exciting and full of anticipation!
After this unusual dining experience, we are now comfortable enough to recommend Nowhere A Restaurant to anyone who is seeking savory culinary art that is not too upscale but rather a local food experience from a team that is highly devoted its work for diners that appreciate their dedication. Besides the distinctive tasting menu, you can make your evening even more refined by adding a $79 wine pairing. The wine list is very hyper-local and enhances your vinous world with an extraordinary expedition to unfamiliar BC territory vineyards.
Chefs Laura Cousins and Clark Deutscher bring delightful agriculture into their kitchen but also are farm-to-table ingredient-driven to you and this is what makes Nowhere A restaurant so unique!
Read the reviews and had reservations of what my food will be like. However, was surprised that it was actually very decent! Food was really good. Flavours were adventuress and wild! Not your everyday steak and seafood restaurant.

Only negative is that it's definitely not the cheapest thing, however, I can see that there was a lot of thought put into every dish.

Service was fantastic from the beginning, greeted and orders taken quickly. Once ordered our food arrived fairly quick considering the amount of people dining in and orders for take out.

We had fruit juice (mango) and it was tasty. For our meal we had the spicy lemongrass chicken spring roll and Lemon grass chicken vermicelli.
All the portions were reasonable for the portion size. The food itself looked very presentable and was enjoyable.

I highly recommend trying this place out to get your Vietnamese meal fix!
Like a glimpse of paradise - a babbling brook, a cooling breeze, a lush garden. Never did I think I would find baby dill fish cake and tofu soup here on the Island. Broth was exceptional. Beef broth tastes like pure marrow, probably the best I've had in a long while. Kind and attentive service, what more could you want?
the restaurant is very nicely decorated with relaxing music. The service was excellent, pretty quick and attentive, though they seem slightly busy as there were several other tables to serve. We ordered pork rolls, lemongrass chicken, house special and curry chicken. The food was also served within a reasonable time frame. The food was awesome! Taste great and the owner is Vietnamese -- some authentic dishes! Would definitely come again if possible!
Great service and the flavours in the curry are delicious! Restaurant is clean and there is a patio for outdoor dining. Recommend a refreshing Vietnamese coffee for dessert.
Cute place and friendly staff but the food was average.

ChIJU9XGCFxzj1QRRf9vmaJNXas,Lum's Chinese Restaurant,4.2,48.430294,-123.401594,378,"First time ordering from Lum's since I'm in Victoria for the week. I ordered some plain chowmein (just chowmein with beansprouts) and some spring rolls. I'll start with the chowmein which was good on flavor, a great portion size, but the noodles were slightly too thick for me. Now this is more of a personal preference but I prefer skinnier noodles as its easier to eat. I'm not knocking the dish, just that thick noodles isn't my preference. The spring rolls however, oh dam, they were delicious! Not to mention the low price they are, I should have ordered more. Highly recommend the spring rolls.
This place is great, I ordered typical fair, Pork fried Rice, Chicken Chow Mein,  some Ginger fried beef and sweet and sour pork.  We had a shell fish allergy in our party and the chef was eager to accommodate and removed the oyster sauce.  The people were super kind and grateful

everyone behind the counter was working like crazy, Awesome food, worth the price.
Great price/quantity ratio, I find the quality of the meat better than others Chinese restaurants in town :) aaand great service, always smiling!
The sweet and sour pork was hard as rock. The chicken was way more breading than actual chicken. The noodles were meh, but not bad.
The food could definitely be better, but it could just be that one time. I will come back to give it another chance when I‚Äôm in town but for now... 3 stars.
I ordered Chicken Chowmein and Sweet and Sour Pork. Both were ready very quickly as they were having a slow night and were normal sized portions. The chow mein only had about 3 small pieces of chicken and was quite heavily doused in soy sauce but the noodles were good quality and well cooked. The Sweet and Sour Pork was all pork, no vegetables, which was a surprise but not unwelcomed and was quite tasty. My only issue was later that evening I suffered a pretty devastating bowel movement and felt quite painfully sick. This was the only food or drink (other than filtered water) I had consumed for many hours and would have been the only cause of my upset stomach. It was a shame as this could have been my go to Chinese food place in Victoria but I'm not a fan of restaurants that give me food poisoning.

Food- mhe.... we had impossible burgers, they are good by it self, but with sauce inside it was not very tasty. I hate mustard, and it was built inside the bun, not ideal.
The service is pretty good although I was expecting the washrooms would've been cleaner.
The food looks better in pictures, but it's still good üëç
The atmosphere is ok.
Simple but the best fast food place around me. The burger was juicy and tasty. This place will be my one of the burger restaurants in Victoria.
Great spot for lunches at work. Super fresh food with big portions and reasonable prices make for a great value. Try their chicken strips and curly fries for sure and their chicken sandwich deal is great.
I visited that restaurant last week and just order a grilled chicken burger which took them 20 minutes to make but I was told only 5 minutes. Service was outrageous and burger was awful. Employee was making burger without gloves that looks so disappointing.

Called ahead to orders for take out and service was great.  Food was good as was presentation but our kids as much as they like it found it too sophisticated for their taste buds and prefer the basic white spot. Depends if you want the fancy brunch which you get here so it‚Äôs a must try out never had before. Very big and filling portions so your getting your moneys worth.
Great food! Huge sizes! We tried different things pork belly eggs Benedict, veggie bowl and french toast and they were all awesome!
Eggs Benedict are great and big for one person, but I would say bowls are for two, they're huge!
French toast is a mots I would say, we tried the apple one and it was unbelievable!
The waiting times are a bit long but I would say they are worth it. It would be better if you could write your name down and come back, but still is good.
Buttermilk biscuits are very good and special too.
Definitely a great place for breakfast/brunch!
Great breakfast place I got waffles and sausage patties. So good.  Everything our table got was delicious as were the drinks. Very popular there were about 10 ppl in line ahead of us but we only waited about 15 minutes.  We sat outside, they had blankets for the customers to put on their laps. I thought that was so thoughtful. Would definitely go back if in the area.
Cute little breakfast spot. We waited quite a bit to get a table. We were a group of 3 and they have a much easier time seating tables of 2 as many groups behind us went ahead of us. We sat outside on their patio just off the sidewalk. I had the traditional breakfast. It was pretty good but did not look as appetizing as I expected from seeing other places come out.
Great breakfast and brunch options. They have many food options and everything looked awesome :)

The veggie bowl was packed with many kind of vegetables and tasty gravy. I loved adding their hot sauce for a little bit of kicks.

I would love to go back and cannot wait to try something else.

ChIJ12OHm3hzj1QRsmL1mKeUMVg,Spoons Diner,4.5,48.4420537,-123.368592,1826,"This is my favorite place to go for breakfast. I went on a Tuesday at 10:00 a.m. No line-up today. It's always packed on the weekends because it is so good. Decent prices, excellent quality and funky atmosphere.
The portions are more than average in my opinion. We both brought home half of our meal.
This is a 6 out of 5 stars place. We had the mini-pancakes, the Side-Chick and the Champignon burger. All 3 were delicious. Definitely worth checking out. The decor is cool as well and the staff is nice. Beware that there may be a lineup, but that‚Äôs because it‚Äôs good.
I want to give Spoons a million stars. This is hands-down one of the best breakfast restaurants in Victoria. The weekly specials are always well thought out and absolutely delicious! The Bailey's benny is one of my favourite things on the menus. The decor is funky and vibrant. They have trivia to keep you entertained at the tables, which is super fun. At peak hangover breakfast time this place can get busy, so be prepared for a line-up. TRUST ME THOUGH, it's worth the wait.
Nice central location with ample free parking. The restaurant is painted in bright colors, it is not very specious, the tables are somewhat packed. We ordered Bangkok Benny and waffle with berry and cream. They both were good but the cream on top of waffle was amazing. The servers were polite and professional. Usually there is a long line up during weekends. Nothing wrong about the restaurant but it was too crowded for me so 4 out of 5 for this reason.
Loved the decor, but then I‚Äôm a bit of a comics geek. Regardless, the food was all amazing and not overpriced. Friendly waitstaff, thanks mamapinkiepie! The sweet prusa for us was a stack of massive chocolate chip pancakes with a peanut butter glaze, yummy! We flipped for it and won the toss!

ChIJ3V7Gf-9zj1QRQGWjUI0K8fw,The Urban Cup Cafe,4.4,48.4600588,-123.3331253,397,"Never been here before and my husband and I were ignored üôÅ at the cash register for close to 5 minutes. I get that you're busy, but at least
train your staff to acknowledge people within the first 40 seconds of entering your establishment that they'll be right with you. But to be ignored üôÅ?
Our food arrived promptly but wasn't impressed with the eggs Benedict and hashbrowns. Oh well you win some you lose some.
A cozy diner-esque caf√©, tucked just off of Shelbourne on church Ave, this little caf√© serves up full breakfast and lunch meals along with espresso drinks and drip coffee. Upon entering there is a display of fresh, house-baked goods on the counter, right beside the till. I tried the cranberry and almond muffin (which was massive), a latte, and a bagel with cream cheese and smoked salmon added.
The coffee was standard issue, although I could tell the quality of the espresso was good. My latte was nice and smooth, with a good amount of foam. I hate overly sweet baked goods, and the muffin was not that. It was sweetened nicely with lots of almond slivers and cranberries, and was served with butter on the side. Muffins are warmed quickly in the microwave for each customer which is appreciated for that freshly baked feel.
Urban cup uses bagels from a local bagel-maker called mt.royal bagels. They're OK, in my opinion, but the smoked salmon is awesome! For $7.50 (plus $2.50 for the bagel itself), you get a generous side portion of cream cream cheese, a big, thick cut of smoked salmon, topped with red onion and arugula. The whole affair is served so you can build it yourself if you're taking it to stay. The salmon is slightly sweet, with a great Smokey flavour throughout. Being a thicker piece of salmon is appreciated, vs. the usual few paper-thin slices. The whole thing is delicious and I highly recommend trying the salmon and bagel.
Atmosphere is nothing special. The caf√© is in a bright location with indoor and outdoor seating. The caf√© is right beside Shelbourne which is a very busy main thoroughfare without many trees or bushes to deaden the sound for outdoor tables, so individual mileage may vary with the outdoor seating.

Overall, very cozy digs with good coffee, and a great salmon and cream cheese bagel. Try the fresh baked goods of the day. There are bigger breakfast and lunch menu items that I will be trying on later visits. 8.5/10
Breakfast here is delicious. Can‚Äôt go wrong with the Eggs Benedict with potatoes. All the baked goods we have had are also amazing!

Main complaint/ thing I wish they would change is that they use farmed salmon :(
Would love to see them serve WILD salmon & not support the fish farm industry!
One of my favorite stops on this end of town! Anywhere I can get an omelete after work is perfect to me! Staff are really great and they've done a great renovation fairly recently. So glad to support this business. Food is great and so is the coffee and baked goods!!!
Cute little coffee shop to start off the day! Loved their latte‚Äôs, and they have a variety of other great drinks as well. I had the The smoked meat sandwich with a side of hash browns. I enjoy the use of a burger bun instead of regular bread. Breakfast was great along side my latte.

Food is a little pricy and the portions are small compared to other areas.
I really enjoy having a morning cup while I do some work!

Taste: Good
Presentation: Good
Service: Excellent
Uniqueness: Alright

Cute cafe and it‚Äôs a nice vibe for cozy.
This is the perfect stop for a quick bite while you‚Äôre out running errands or doing homework. I tried the chicken pozole and a slice of the banana bread. The soup was absolutely amazing! I got a cup of the soup and you have an option for a side of bread or rice. I tried the bread and it was so fresh and went great with the soup. The banana bread wasn‚Äôt the best, it was a little tough to bite into, but I did order it in the afternoon. The cafe itself has only a few tables for mostly groups or two, but many seemed to be available when I went. Will definitely be stopping by again!
We weren‚Äôt sure if this is where we wanted to stop for lunch, but we were glad we did! The staff was very helpful and enthusiastic about our menu choices, and gave us a good timeframe for when we‚Äôd get our food.

The curried egg sandwich was fresh and light, made with their house-made bread. The salad was also really nice and very tasty. Glad we stopped in for a bite!
It took me way too long to try some of the sandwiches here, but now I cannot be stopped. The Creamy Almond Veggie and Sweet Chili Chicken sandwiches are so fresh and delicious, it's everything you can ask for in a sandwich. The soup and salads look very yummy as well, so can't wait to try them. You will find me on the outside street patio with my dog on too many days of the week. Watch out around this time of year, the beautiful tree out front, will pelt you in the head with it's little spiky green acorn thingys.
Really cute spot to have a coffee or grab a bite to eat. I had a bowl of the coconut curry soup. I highly recommend it! There were lots of options for GF and vegetarian.

Great little hole in the wall spot.
Will not that there is not many tables within the restaurant if you‚Äôre planning dine in.

The decor is what you‚Äôd expect of a name like Sour Pickle cafe.. there are pickles everywhere, it makes it interesting.

The service was quick from our orders being taken to our meal being served. The food was also good quality for a good price, quite tasty.
I highly recommend checking out this spot for a breakfast/brunch area.
The Sour Pickle is quite pleasing to dine at. Do not go there if you have time restraints because everything is made from scratch. We waited 20-25 minutes, but it was worth it.

The Denver breakfast item is only on their special item menu posted outside the establishment, and I really enjoyed it! The sandwich is toasted to perfection and filled with so many healthy goodies. It came with a side of potatoe salad which was the best I have ever had... ever.

The Tortilla Omelet is a HUGE serving with lightly fried potato in the side. If you like garlic, then this is the breakfast item for you. My brother and dad enjoyed it.

The Veggie Omelet is also quite enjoyable here. The cheese ontop the egg is notably flavorful with the basil pesto.
My favourite place to get breakfast with friends! Every time we go here, we are treated to excellent service and good food at a reasonable price. We will definitely continue to have weekend brunch here in the future. My go-to is the egg enchiladas.
This is a very nice small family owned cafe 10 min walk from downtown Victoria.
They have great options for breakfast and lunch. Their omelettes are really good!
I was surprised by the bubble tea as well.
They do not accept credit card. Only cash or debit

Rise and Grind on Broad Street is easily my favourite go-to casual breakfast, brunch, and coffee destination in downtown Victoria. The food options are diverse and made to order, plus the brewed fresh Discovery Coffee is always a hit. Highly recommended, never disappointed.
Finally after 2 years living downtown I have found a coffee shop that is absolutely wonderful. They have excellent breakfast, amazing/healthy lunch options and more. The staff are nice and welcoming, and not snobby or pretentious like many of the other coffee/breakfast spots downtown Victoria. Excellent location too!! Look forward to coming to Rise and Grind (almost) every morning. Thank you for your great cafe and service!!
Wow amazing breakfast sandwich I had there. Their ingredients were super fresh and of high quality, the recipe and choice of ingredients were a perfect blend of flavor which delivered an harmonious taste experience. The portion was satisfying and the price decent.
I recommend.
Totally awesome little spot. I had an excellent almond milk latte and we had great sandwiches. Awesome selection for under 10 bucks (most have bacon and avo so they aren‚Äôt light!). The crowd was a mix of tourists and locals and the decor & music were tight! Definitely a great choice for fast, filling, tasty, and cheap breakfast.

ChIJx76v4YR0j1QRMjRtYdiFRRg,The Ruby on Johnson,4.5,48.427369,-123.3653465,986,"This just may have been the best breakfast I've ever ordered at a restaurant. We ordered the berry waffles and the poutine benny and my oh my were they delicious. The contrast between the sweet and savory meals was delightful (my wife and I shared our meals). The waffles were honestly the best waffles I have ever eaten. Each bite nearly brought a tear to my eye from being so tasty. The only complaint is that I live about 1000 miles away from The Ruby üòû. This restaurant alone tempts me to uproot my family and move to Victoria just to eat breakfast here every week.

A side note, we were with our 17 month old baby and the staff was sooo kind and accommodating with him.
You definitely gotta try this out!! We knew this diner has a special history which I can tell why locals keep coming back. Mesmerizing decor and menu is extensive; it was hard to decide where to sit and what to order. We tried their delicious breakfast menu. Generous portion and we were so full that we needed to walk it out. The staff was humble and all their recommendations were spot on. Must try !!
Took a while to get food out because they were so busy. But wow worth the wait! Everything was delicious.  The atmosphere was fun. Will  definitely come back if we're going to come visit Victoria again. Thanks!
This place is spectacular. I'm a big breakfast guy and actively seek out good breakfast joints.  This is by far my favorite in Victoria. The service, the food, the atmosphere, and the fact they're open early (early bird here).

I got the brisket hash which was absolutely amazing. I love hash and the two poached eggs over brisket with crispy potato hash was the perfect meal after my morning workout.
The Ruby is connected to the hotel we are staying at next door. Breakfast is not included in the room rate but this is very convenient. The cappuccino is delicious. I had eggs and bacon with hash and toast and everybody else helped me eat the bacon and hash. I am told the quinoa cooked in coconut milk is very tasty. The server was very personable. There was no marmalade for my toast. They did bring Splenda for my cappuccino. Water comes in mason jars not glasses. The menu is huge. They don‚Äôt do dinner.

Lovely lady helped us with our lunch! Definitely a good spot for a quick meal.
Great place to have breakfast.  Delicious coffee, sandwiches, bacon omelet option and soup of the day. The atmosphere is cozy and friendly.
Best vanilla bean frappe I‚Äôve ever had!! Food is top notch and deserts are generous portions for the price you pay. This is my go-to on a Sunday afternoon. The owners are a ray of sunshine too.
Cute little neighborhood spot run by two very nice people. Sandwiches, coffee (hot and cold), salads, breakfast, baked goods, soups all for sale. Such a cozy little spot during my short day trip to Victoria.

They also have a small boutique where you can purchase scrubs, stationery, apparel, accessories and candles

We ordered:

-  ""The Vacation"" pressed juice - perfect if you want a sweet and refreshing drink
- Breakfast burger with truffle fries
- Mushroom toast with cashew cheese
I‚Äôve been in this restaurant twice: once sat outside and once inside.
Pros: food is delicious and healthy,
Service is nice and friendly,
Decor and furniture is modern and relaxing colours,
Outside patio with heater,
Some beautiful and cute merchandise.

Con: there is something wrong with audio insulation of the restaurant that makes it very noisy. So if you need a cosy and quiet place that you can chat easily with friends, it‚Äôs better to sit outside.
Have been meaning to check it out for awhile now. Only a forty minute wait to get a table on late Saturday morning. Great coffee selection. Food came to the table quickly. Both the breakfast sandwich and the tuna salad were delicious. Will definitely go back.
Bear & Joey is one of my favourite brunch restaurants in Victoria! I‚Äôd say the best patio setup with heaters if needed, allows for dogs / has water station, excellent service and professionalism. We had the Avocado Toast and added prosciutto, and the PotatoRosti and added the bacon + avocado. The bacon literally melts in your mouth, it‚Äôs so good. Coffee and Kombucha also a great choice! Highly recommend.
Our friends have been urging us to try this place. But we had a ferry to catch and didn't want to be stuck downtown. However, after Google guided us to a less-than-appealing cafe in Christchurch, we decided that we might as well try Bear and Joey. I was dressed in sensible 'ferry-traveling-and-hiking' garb and we didn't have a reservation, the ma√Ætre d' wasn't thrilled but seated us anyway. One of the original reason I hesitated in coming was the menu. But once we were there, the menu made a lot more sense and we actually had a hard time choosing. My weakness was breakfast sandwich, but at the last minute, I ordered the pork belly sandwich. My partner ordered the fresh toast, of course! We think this place should get a Michelin Star for sure. From ingredients to execution, the food was amazing. I usually only eat salad because it is healthy but actually hating it. But the Bear and Joey kohlrabi and picked cabbage salad was AMAZING, not boring at all. I couldn't stop eating it and finished the salad before attacking the fennel and orange pork belly sandwich. The bread was extra crusty which was quite enjoyable. The pork belly had enough fat to melt in my mouth. Consuming this was a wondering experience. There was a lot of 'mmm' sounds and smiles coming from across the table while my partner enjoyed the french toast. There was a lot more variety of fruit on the french toast that were not mentioned on the menu. If this place was in Vancouver, I imagine it might take us a while to get a reservation. Well done!

Unreal. More please!
What a wonderful time and experience in Victoria. We were in the area to try and see if we could go to blue Fox Caf√© originally, but there was such a long lineup that we decided to check into our hotel and look around the neighborhood. Our eyes could not avert the beautiful hot pink colour that was this little diner. Floyd's has a great menu with breakfast brunch and lunch items and the staff are so kind. We ordered the chicken and waffles Benny and the BC hash and the portions are very generous and reasonable. Each dish still comes in around 18-20$ but we felt it was worth it. Highly recommend if you're in the area. As an additional note, the washrooms are tiny and I would say accessibility wise it is a little tight. They also have seating outdoors which is quite nice.
Casual local diner in a lovely little neighborhood. The restaurant itself is very eclectic, with a friendly and nostalgic atmosphere ‚Äî magenta exterior, mismatched artwork on the walls, no frills decor and aesthetic. Super friendly service, servers had lots of suggestions for things to do in the city. Good prices and honestly really great breakfast ‚Äî serving up that thicc bacon, they don‚Äôt mess around. Darn good eggs, and what I believe to be house made or locally made sour dough (honestly some of the best sourdough ever). Can‚Äôt wait to go back next time I visit the island
I tried the vegetarian hash... it tasted good. The salsa was really yummy. The potatoes were crispy. The rest of the food : poutine and the lumberjack was tasty too. The food was fresh and the portion was good for 2. They also have bottomless coffee for 4.25..
The staff was friendly and helpful. Highly recommend this diner. They serve all day breakfast and lunch. The wait time for a table was 10 minutes. Street parking available.
The food was delicious. Usually, there is a line at the diner. Luckily none during our visit. Every food we ordered were in huge portion and mouthwatering. Everything on the menu sounds tasty.

The diner was really clean and cute. Customer service was awesome. All crews were friendly and approachable. We went back to our hotel full and happy with the service we experienced.

We will be back here again on our next visit. To taste their yummy food.

Ive always had a great experience at the downtown location, but this one on Fort was simply horrible.
Arriving on site to 3 dirty tables outside, no biggie.
Our meal was delivered without cutlery and I had to get up to go get my own.
No one asked once how our meal was.
In fact, when my Eggs Benedict arrived, she placed in front of me a half order and said, ""Here's one. The second will arrive shortly.""
How about just deliver me what I ordered?
I had to ask for more water which didn't even happen after requesting it.
After sitting around for 10 minutes, I finally decided to go inside to pay because no one was coming over to help us.
Just a lame experience overall.
We had Sunday brunch. It was very busy but they did their best in getting us seated and served as quick as possible.  Food was delicious! We had the lemon berry French toast and full breakfast. The Scottish scones were delicious too!
This quaint little breakfast place is the cutest! I loved the decor and the old-timey atmosphere! The food was massive portions for the price, and everything was dont so well, you can taste the love they used to cook your food! The service was friendly and personable. Everyone looked happy to be there!
Their mimosa was really good as a side point, they used pulpy orange juice for mine and I was overjoyed!!
I really hope you think about eating here next time you're in the neighborhood, some of the best food I've had across Canada!
amazing servers and lovely atmosphere - got a chai latte which was delicious and the southern belle eggs benedict with scottish potato scone. I wasn't the biggest fan of the eggs benedict but it was just not the flavour combo for me! would have loved another type for sure
The food was delicious, they served very quick and the waitress was very nice. Although we waited for 30 minutes to get in; was a great time and food.

They have a huge variety of delicious food, including the two pictured below. Peanut butter bowl, and a side of smash potatoes!
We ordered a sausage party and two peanut butter bowls. The food was excellent and quite enjoyable! This place is a food truck so there is seating available under tents. The reason we are giving this place four stars instead of five was because they don‚Äôt really have a large variety of drink options that you would except from a place that serves breakfast/brunch/lunch options. Other than that, the food was super enjoyable and there‚Äôs a large variety.
Decided to try this breakfast food truck. I had the loaded dish, which was great. My accompanying party had the vegetable sandwich, which was also good, but maybe priced a little high. Service was quick and polite. I'd recommend.
Great little breakfast spot. Pictured here is the smashed hash; potatoes with egg & sauce. Delicious and filling. I‚Äôve eaten through pretty much everything on their menu now and it‚Äôs all superb. Excellent customer service as well.
This food is definitely a reason to be up before 7am! I personally am not a breakfast person but I am now. Their loaded hash puts Denny's famous smothered and covered to shame. Friendly and fast service and amazing food! What else can you ask for? Telling everyone I know about this and will definitely be back! 10/10

We ordered 3 items which were
-3 meat burger which came with crispy bacon and tasty patty beef. The bun not too dry which was good.
- Adam Waffle Bananas Caramel is recommended because the mix within bandana and waffle with custard really new for me but it perfectly combines.
- the Gargantuan Breakfast just regular breakfast with additional cantaloupe melon, the great thing the pancakse it's soft and has berry in it.
Really salty and sweet in 1 plate.
Quite busy but the staff made sure we got everything we needed despite being short staffed. Food was great but quite a large menu so I would suggest looking at it before coming here. Fruit was nice and fresh. My partners ham was a little overcooked and the coffee was a little watered down but I enjoyed the experience.
Best breakfast in Victoria- you can get anything you want from omelettes to pancakes and French toast, sandwiches, and so much more. The ingredients are so fresh and the fruit they serve is making - melons, berries - even gooseberries- kiwi, banana and more . This is just the side fruit that comes with the meal.  Simple decor , friendly staff - definitely a destination for an amazing breakfast
This restaurant/ server gave us such a weird vibe. The server did all the regular work, but he was grumpy. He wanted us to order quick, eat extremely quick and leave even the restaurant is not busy (weekday 12 to 1pm).

To Owner: thank you for your reply and kind offer. Just hope this is just individual situation.
Large menu with kids menu as well. Food is OK and prices are OK although sides and coffee are a bit pricy. We had 2 coffees ($7) 2 adult meals, 1 kids meal, and 2 sides - total was $58 before tip. Decent place for breakfast if you're craving that.

When we go early in the morning already had line up so can see how popular it is. It‚Äôs featured in so many articles about the breakfast you have to try in Victoria. Actually at beginning we are little skeptical but it turns out it‚Äôs very good. The portion is huge and they are generous on putting ingredients the plates are full :). We are super full after eating that we skip the lunch. We highly recommend this to if you want to try traditional breakfast in this beautiful city
Really good dishes! I tried the Fox‚Äôs grill and it was really delicious. We waited 1hour 30min to get in. It was surely worth it. Very good serving, you get full real fast! Great breakfast!
They are usually pretty busy and there was a wait for us to get in, but definitely worth it. The food was very yummy and very large portions for the price, I would definitely recommend. One plate would‚Äôve honestly been enough for both my friend and I. The decor and ambience is also very nice, service is quite attentive. Although a tad slow because of how busy they were. I would definitely come again.
One of those rare times the lineup wasn't very long so we took advantage.  It's a busy spot but the service was efficient and the food came out quickly.  I had the Angel Eyes Eggs Benny.  The eggs were perfectly cooked.  The homefries were crispy.  Didn't find it had oodles of flavour, but of course that has more to do with my choice of order.  My friend had the Moroccan Chicken Club which he really liked.  Will go back, but likely not when it's lined up.
There was a line up outside the door, but luckily it moved fairly quickly. Service was quick, and the portions were huge. The food was delicious, we were very happy with our meals! I would definitely come back for breakfast again.

Food is good, the burrito was very flavourful and wrapped well. Giving it 4 stars only because they automatically charge you 15% for tips. The only service we got was the staff bringing out our food to the table. Not sure if that warrants a 15% mandatory tip.
My dad and I were visiting Victoria on our way to shop RVs for my parents across the island. Dad ate the Vegan Hash, which he said was so delicious, large portion and very filling, while I shopped a few stores nearby. As I finished, I returned for a Chai Tea Latte with oat milk and it was also well done; flavorful, smooth and creamy. Would visit again next trip!
Came here for breakfast sandwiches and loved the cozy laid back vibes.  The breakfast sandwiches we got were sooooo tasty ü§§  I got the Owen and my partner got the Weekender, both amazing.  The kind of delicious where you zone out while eating it because you're just lost in the flavours.  YUM!
Ordered the congee.

As a biased person being Asian, it was not the congee I expected especially visually. This one was outstanding with colors and textures. The bold ingredients were sitting atop a bed of thick brown rice. The rice was not too viscous and also not as fluid as Asian congee would be generally.  It might be close to the viscosity of oats where it will still fall out of your spoon if you tip it over but not immediately.

The temperature also is quite different.  I'm guessing this was about 50¬∞C / 122¬∞F.

So eating the congee, the ingredients were grouped together and arranged quite thoughtfully. I thought of mixing everything together just like you generally would in an Asian congee, but my senses at this point whispered otherwise.

So I went about my dish picking the ingredients, often combining 2-3 at a time as I was scouring away from the bed of viscous rice underneath. I found that eating it this way gives an easier time to distinguish and appreciate the flavors and textures as compared to having everything mixed together.  This made the dish quite engaging as you try different combinations of the ingredients. It was light yet felt.
Different from Asian congee and unique in it's way.

The staff is extremely friendly and the food is THE BEST there is. Always SUPER FRESH AND TASTY. my favourite things are their Montreal meat sandwich with their homemade sweet and spic.  Plus their chicken noodle soup reminds me of something my mom makes when I‚Äôm sick but even better. ( sorry mom). The chicken strips are like no others you‚Äôve had in the city. They are buttery and taste like the are made fresh as well. The portions are HUGE and I can‚Äôt get over how delicious everything is. I‚Äôve tried quite a few of the deserts and of course they do not disappoint. They taste homemade and so fresh.  The Halong Bay Salad is something I tried new and of course it was exceptional like everything I‚Äôve ever tried. Their food is worth every penny and I promise you won‚Äôt be disappointed. I‚Äôd start with the Montreal meat sandwich with homemade sweet and spicy mustard. You‚Äôll thank me later. I‚Äôve tried so many delis and sandwiches in Victoria since I‚Äôve lived here my whole life and NOTHING EVEN COMES CLOSE TO THEIR INSANELY , DELICIOUS FOOD WHICH WILL HAVE YOU COMING BACK FOR MORE. I ORDER AT LEAST 1-3x a week it‚Äôs that good ( even if I don‚Äôt eat it that day I know it‚Äôs made fresh so I can keep it in my fridge for the next day or 2 and it still tastes phenomenal). Also the customer service is amazing. Tron goes above and beyond to make his customers happy. Trust me when I say it‚Äôs one of Victoria‚Äôs best kept secrets. I promise you‚Äôll be so happy with any food item you choose and they have something for everyone !! Try it ASAP
Cute interior, central location, good service. I got the Montr√©al smoked meat sandwich and squash curry soup - The smoked meat isn't Schwartz or Dunn's quality but it was still good. The soup was delish.
Cute little cafe with some amazing sandwiches and cookies!

Their smoked meat sandwiches are by far their best thing on menu. Pieces were fair and there is a tone of other options as well. They even have some Vietnamese dishes as well, most notably Vietnamese sandwiches.

The atmosphere is beautiful, almost reminding of a classic dinner. Service is extremely quick for how small yet busy it gets! I would most definitely recommend coming for some breakfast!
I got their daily lunch special which I believe is the Montreal beef sandwich. Bread's really soft and fresh and the meat was succulent and fully loaded (ordered the super size). Polished off the coleslaw which tells you something because I usually despise coleslaw in general, and the chips are good sized and crisp. Owners running the shop are very polite and the food was made to order at a very decent speed (wife at the shop slicing away at the mandolin while husband was chatting with me and the work colleague who recommended this place to try)

For those who are griping about pricing of food... seriously, use your thinking caps on. Rent ain't cheap and they're in a prime location. They're not a franchise or a chain, and there is a lot of overhead plus the rising costs of food ingredients in general. It causes me to facepalm when shoddy reviewers make an incredible poor comparison when their education is lower than a 10th grader and have absolute zero business knowledge. The pricing is on par with the value of the entrees.

Anyway, keep up with the good work. I probably can't afford it on a daily basis because I'm usually a glutton with good food nowadays and can easily burn a hole if I'm not careful but definitely worth it as a weekly or monthly treat for me.
Very casual, small local joint but great Montreal smoked meat sandwiches!!!  Very friendly owners who genuinely care that you enjoy whatever you order on their menu. A must experience.

Delicious korean sandwich and coffee, I really recommend this place. There's an outdoor seated area and public tables.
I had the Farmhouse Classic and an iced hazelnut latte. The sandwich was a good portion, piled with ingredients, super tasty. It was a little spicy from the Serrano Mayo but not in an overpowering way. The ingredients were very fresh and the bun was soft and held up well. The latte was also very good. The coffee was smooth and they offer alternative milks with no additional up charge. Would highly recommend if you‚Äôre looking for a good breakfast spot!

We particularly like the eggs Benny, which are prepared with a delicious cashew cream sauce. The seedy bread is also terrific. The coffee drinks are especially creative and are served with beautiful flourishes of design and usually edible flowers. The manager, Amira, is so incredibly kind and attentive. All in all, this is a wonderful restaurant.
Gem of gems in Victoria and probably in BC as a whole. Exquisite presentation all around, both in the beautiful plating of the kitchen selections and the layout of the place. The cafe drinks in particular were stunning, visually speaking.

What truly makes this place stand out is the homemade quality of what seems to be the most fresh ingredients‚Ä¶ both plates we had were delicately crafted: ample sweetness, tasteful seasonings, beautiful pairing of ingredients, humble portions, and a soaring sense of ‚Äúfreshness.‚Äù While prices are justifiably premium, it is more than fair considering the relentless quality of every offering on the menu and sincerity of the staff.

All around, an incredibly memorable and enjoyable dining experience. Quite the standout in what might be one of the best spots on the island!
The cutest heritage house with delicious brunch made with fresh local ingredients. We had the half and half (pancake and half Benny), the golden Benny and their bone broth. Everything was colourful, flavourful, and high quality. Highly recommend you go at least 15min before they open so you can snag the first seating.
Very unique menu! Beautiful location. I got the dandelion beverage with chaga (in photos) and was pleasantly surprised as to how tasty it was! The coffees and broths were also great quality. I had the tartine, my sister had sleeping beauty pancakes, and my dad had the golden Benny with extra bacon. Of the three, our favorite was the Benny (especially the bacon) and the pancakes. You will not be disappointed.
We had an absolutely fantastic experience here!
And will definitely be back.

The food was delicious and super fresh (ps I love how small their menu is! Always better to do a few things, but very well, instead of doing lots and nothing really right‚Ä¶)

The drinks were creative and very good. Perfect temperature to drink them straight away - not too hot, not too cold (we ordered the beet latte and a cappuccino).

Also, how cute and beautiful is this place, which is located in a cute house right in the neighborhood‚Ä¶

Last but not least, they also have a little store/to go area in case you don‚Äôt want to go in for a sit down meal!

A true precious gem in Greater Victoria. A small family owned and run local business with top-shelf, tasty  homemade creations combined with good, old-fashioned customer service.  When we were there the owners were fully engaged and present and genuinely cared about the food and the needs and desires of customers, checking in to see if anything was needed.  We really appreciated this concern and commitment to service . All food offerings were generous portions of scrumptious dishes presented with an obvious love of food more common in Quebec than western Canada. Will definitely recommend without hesitation.

The food was the only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 - taste of garlic was a bit too strong for me personally. Overall, I had a great afternoon here and will come back for coffee if I ever pass by the area.

ChIJqQBhYIV0j1QRGs8cES0RXck,Soupa Cafe,4.6,48.425553,-123.363678,206,"We won a gift certificate and had never been here. We went in on a wet, cold day and had a bowl of chili and a bowl of chicken stew soup. They were both delicious, you can tell they were homemade. Very pleasant staff. A bit pricey but I think it's like that everywhere now. $13 for a bowl of soup/stew. We were very pleased overall.
I can't say enough AMAZING things about this place! I ordered through skip, had never heard of them and took a chance! I'm so happy I did! One of my new favourite places to add to my list! I order a lot of skip for my picky eater mom in long-term care and she LOVED everything from turkey, brie + spinach sandwich on rye to the coconut chicken soup and even the Cobb Salad! A great way to get her to eat her veggies!

Thank you Soupa team and for double checking the receipt to make sure I had everything for my order! You will definitely hear from me again very soon! Through skip  and hopefully in person sometime in the near future.

Love the real turkey in the sandwich and Cobb salad! Best bacon I have ever had!
I'm going to tell everyone to go here!
I visited for the first time downtown as I was looking for a soup place. I had the veg chilli and it tasted better than I expected. They offer toppings for your soup which I liked a lot.  The bread that came with it was good and moist. I also picked up a vegan brownie which was yummy. I found the price very reasonable. The staff were super friendly. I'd definitely return.
We heard so many great things and were very eager to try out the newer Esquimalt location for our Friday night take out meal. The staff were amazing and friendly,  and the restaurant smelled amazing at time of pickup.

I tried the daily special, a 7 grain chicken soup, and my wife got the creamy mushroom. They both looked and smelled awesome, but after the first bite we were both really disappointed... all we could taste was salt. I've had canned soup with significantly less salt content. I was quite hungry, so despite this I finished it, but my wife could barely eat half. By the end of the night my joints felt swollen and my face was puffy, it was that salty.

I'm glad that so many people enjoy their products, local  businesses deserve that love, but  unfortunately,  we won't be going back.
Let's get to the point: this was the best breakfast bagel I've ever had. The food in this new little restaurant is exquisite, seemingly simple yet beautifully flavoured. As for options, there seem to be a humble yet varied menu of both classics and vegetarian options available, and the staff were more than willing to accommodate me when I mentioned an allergy. I wish I could show you a picture of what I chose, but I ate it too fast! But suffice to say, the breakfast egg'n'bacon bagel is well worth your time.

The staff here are very friendly and helpful. They brought me my breakfast within short order, and checked up on me after to see how I was doing and to make sure i was enjoying myself. I was! The interior is clean and simple as well, nothing dramatic or overstated, although the table art is very fun to look at.  Fairly spacious too. It's a bit like a diner, fresh and to the point, but much less greasy.

In short, don't pass by this little place if you can help it. It's a little startup with a big heart, and it shows in the taste of what you eat.

The food presentation was perfect and the portions were large. I ate both breakfast and dinner here and was not disappointed. Where else can you get both chicken and waffles & red snapper fish and chips under the same roof?
I stopped by on an extremely hot day for lunch with a friend. The patio was great to sit on and has a great view of the inner harbor. You are able to see the sea plane come in and out. The food was also great, I had the falafel sliders, and they were great. Good atmosphere and the wait staff were very friendly and accommodating. Thank you.
Finally decided to come check out Bellevilles for brunch and my god it was delicious. We tried all of the specials they had on and we're not disappointed whatsoever. The food was top notch, the services was friendly, and the atmosphere was delightful. I will definitely be back!!
Bursting with flavour! Beautiful presentation. Pleasant, attentive service. Time and allergy sensitive service. Decor which promotes local artist Paul Archer and takes you on a visual adventure to remember.  An awesome way to start the day.
Some of Victoria's best eggs Benedict and hundy Victoria's best tater tots. Also, breakfast happy hour specials if you're so inclined. Nice large patio overlooking the bay too.

Staff were superb and very friendly. The coffee was nice and they were very nice about working around the combos for alternative choices. Only problem was the food, I am incredibly disappointed about the avocado bean burrito. I was unimpressed that the beans tasted like they came out of a Heinz beans can and the avocado wasn‚Äôt ripe, it was hard and had no taste as it wasn‚Äôt ready to be used yet. Very small as well
for almost $9, I would have went somewhere else for breakfast if I knew it was going to be like that..
As a proud resident of the Gorge neighbourhood, I am thrilled to see a coffee shop open up. My Americano was delicious and I look forward to trying everything else on the menu. I also saw that they have baby chairs, which is always a bonus as a parent.
Had the eggvacado bean burrito... the beans were from a can and the egg was very dry and the burrito for what you actually got was not worth the price in my opinion. If your in a pinch then this will suffice but if you have options go check out another eatery. The atmosphere is underwhelming and there is only two dining tables to actually eat at, the rest of the seating is couch style with coffee tables for eating. Service was like going to a coffee shop, nothing extra. My husband had a latte and said it was burnt tasting.
Im so happy to have a little coffee place I can walk to with decent hours. The coffee is excellent. The lady at the front is so sweet. The food was awesome, small and simple but very good (and well priced). We will definitely be back! üòÑ My bf says ""its a good cuppa mocha""

Okay. Context. This is not a fancy place. But they deserve a 4 because of no frills, straightforward Chinese food that I am familiar with. Savory. Tasty. With all the sauce, noodles, rice and viand combinations. If you‚Äôre in Downtown in looking for a comfort food, this is the place!
Honest Chinese food at a reasonable price.  Consistent and reliable. The menu does not change that I have noticed, but what ever they make, the food is good. Friendly and helpful.
excellent in every way. food. service, price.
Would have liked more clients to be here for breakfast...will be back!
Cute little place, definitely didn't expect breakfast to be as good as what it was. Prices are right, decent portion size, and good service. While maybe not my go to restaurant, I wouldn't complain about having to eat here!

Hubby ordered The Canadian, and was pleased that it wasn't too sweet, it had generous portions of fresh strawberries and real whipped cream and the hint of cinnamon and real maple syrup were the perfect match. I had a 'pick your own combination' of bananas, fresh blueberries, generous helpings of real whipped cream and real maple syrup and it was delicious. My son had a sweet choice of the Oreo Waffle, complete with crumbled Oreo cookies, chocolate syrup and whipped cream. The waffles were made fresh to order and were light and not too sweet and the servings of toppings were fresh and generous. The service was also friendly, and efficient. We stopped for a quick bite at this little restaurant¬†and couldn't stop raving about how fresh and tasty it was. Next time, I will go for one of the savoury options. Overall, a great option for breakfast, lunch or tea time in downtown Victoria.
First time visit. Tried the vegetarian options as it was closer to lunch time.
The ""Mexican waffle"" was great and will highly recommend it. Try it with scrambled eggs.
The vegetarian was decent, but not much too rave about.
Fantastic waffles for a late night treat. The place could be cleaned and fixed up a bit, but let's be honest you're not there for the atmosphere.
Definitely one of the best waffle places in vic by far! The worker who was there was super nice, and definitely made the appearance of my waffle look super pretty and appetizing! It was super yummy and I‚Äôm so glad that this place is open till 4 am on Fridays and Saturday‚Äôs, because it definitely is a great midnight snack.

I‚Äôm just wondering why there‚Äôs only one worker though for the whole restaurant even though it‚Äôs late at night?
I just can't seem to find something decent here. The staff are always nice, and boy can they cook a waffle, but the combos are always justa little off. got the ham and cheese, but it had cinnamon on it (not mentioned on the menu) that totally ruined it. Sure I could get just a waffle and maple syrup, but then whats the point? this place is for a waffle MEAL not a regular ol waffle... All the combos are like this, so maybe just keep your mind open for some odd ingredient choices

ChIJragnczh0j1QR3mnIVsh2V54,Marina Dockside Eatery,4.1,48.4244843,-123.3022533,144,"Super friendly service. We got a fabulous peanut butter cookie a bagel, sandwich and some house chips.

My 4 yr old said the cookie was amazing. My husband thoroughly enjoyed his bagel. My salmon sandwich with the arugula was extremely satisfying. And the house chips are a must. I even put them into my sandwich and had no regrets.

And you can‚Äôt beat eating outside by the water.
This caf√© has changed hands over the years, but in its latest iteration it is known as the Marina Dockside Eatery.

I am here on a Thursday morning, just after opening.  There are about ten patrons here, enjoying coffees, pastries, and food.  There is also takeout available.

I‚Äôve spotted a Kindle, a magazine, and the Times Colonist newspaper being read.  Quiet music is being played and only the sounds of conversation, and refreshments being made behind the counter,  are heard.

Outside the entire expanse of windows that wrap around the caf√© are sailboats, other patrons on the terrace, and those who work nearby.

Altogether a lovely spot for this morning‚Äôs cappuccino, which is good, but not quite strong enough for my taste.

Update:  All of my cappuccinos have been superb since.  Well done, baristas!

The caf√© offers breakfast, teas, coffees, wraps, sandwiches, chowder, soups, and other similar fare.

While it has a good ambience, the d√©cor could use a bit of an update.  It is mainly beige walls, fairly modern chairs and tables, though, there is a definite overdraft of beige and brown.  Some pop of colour would be welcomed; even some nautical d√©cor - not the tacky type - but some better pieces.

If you‚Äôre driving, just park at Turkey Head and walk down to the caf√©, or else use the ramp if need be.  Buses also stop at Turkey Head.

The Marina restaurant, just up the ramp,  just recently closed its doors, but the last time I was there for a meal it was far too quiet and the food wasn‚Äôt altogether anything to write home about, so to speak.  It was an icon, certainly, but time moves on.

I will definitely return to this caf√©.  A relaxing place, overall and friendly, chatty, staff.
Breakfast bun was great! Banana bread okay. Service was hands off for amount of people working. This place IS open even tho they don't answer the phone and one of the dockside restaurants says they are closed (its upstairs)
Friendly staff, good London fog, excellent salmon seafood chowder. I would definitely have that chowder again. Perfect comfort food on a chilly afternoon.
We had a lovely breakfast here, very relaxed atmosphere, staff were friendly and beautiful views of the Marina.

Their mandate is fantastic, and it doesn't hurt that the food is quite delicious.  When you eat at the cafe, part of the proceeds go towards their efforts to feed our community.  I had heard such wonderful things about this place, and it did not disappoint.  Get a caesar, go for the breakfast hash.  My partner got the pancakes and loved them.  I'm pretty sure you can't go wrong.
Thank you so much for your ""can't pay"" payment option on frozen items! If I could use my Visa Debit Acct, I'd love to donate $ sometime.
Went and did some bread bagging at the Ref Cedar Cafe in order to support our community. The people who work and volunteer here are even better than the delicious food! I highly refined this local joint!
I chose to volunteer here with my stepson to have him see and experience the incredibly wonderful help that comes out of Red Cedar Cafe. He was welcomed by the entire staff and was happy to be put to work to help prepare the nutritious meals prepared there.

If you‚Äôre new to Victoria too it‚Äôs a great place to volunteer doing delivery as it teaches you the layout of the city.
I was injured at work recently and my employer (who also provided housing accommodations) laid me off and essentially evicted me. The Red Cedar Cafe has been my saving grace, allowing me to have access to affordable (and/or free) healthy and filling meals.

I recommend supporting them if you can (with money, or food donations) because they‚Äôve got an unreal meal program that undoubtedly helps a lot of individuals and families in need. I hope to volunteer for them in the future so I can give back!

I had two different girls here who seriously lacked etiquette- but Charlotte took the cake. I have never met a server so rude and callous before.

A very welcome addition to the food options in and around the Hudson from the lovely folks from Shatterbox Coffee.

I needed a coffee place to kill some time as I waited for someone. Walked here with my baby stroller and we were nearly the only customers. The service was great, and the matcha latte was one of the best I've ever had.
As the outdoor staircase in front leads to the entrance, if you're a wheelchair user or have a stroller or otherwise can't use the stairs, you have to go through the lobby, go to the elevator, go to P1 (I had to ask a staff member which level it was as there wasn't a sign), take the left corner door, go through the heavy wood door which isn't automatic and would be difficult to open with a wheelchair, and you'll find the Cafe.

Because most customers grab and go back to their hotel rooms, this is a lovely quiet Cafe if you're looking for some peace and quiet steps away from the hustle and bustle of downtown. It was pricey - $16 for a latte and chia/fruit cup, but I feel like it is probably comparable to other coffee shops right now.
Great staff‚Ä¶but Arcadia Salad $12!!! A small amount of lettuce, 3 small pecans, one cherry tomatoe and 2 slices of carrot with small vinaigrette. I wont be back‚Ä¶
The staff system needs to change, the elder lady emily is very rude. just because she has been there a while does not give her a right to mistreat people and be disrespectful. Train your staff on basic etiquette before hiring them. wouldn't recommend.
Felt warm and thankful taking a hot London Fog and fresh snack here in this remarkable winter afternoon, Dec. 21, 2022. when outside it was -7, and most restaurants were closed due to such a rare cold weather conditions.

ChIJZ2Uw_Z9zj1QRFCjnF1Q7DE0,Uptown Bistro,4.1,48.4522057,-123.3810488,435,"First time going to the Uptown Bistro. Loved it and would return. Ordered their calimari which had a great spice to it (was so good) and no unpleasant fishy taste! Highly recommend you try this. I also got the chicken strips and fries. The strips were good, the fries were great. Waitress was friendly and attentive. Great meal!
Updated: I can no longer recommend breakfast. I don't know what happened. It used to be a great place for a classic breakfast. Now it's like some experimental kitchen serving unrecognizable dishes. I tried the French toast, a simple dish of bread, eggs, and milk, fried and served with butter and maple syrup. What arrived was thin slices of bread absolutely drowning in what I can only describe as thick orange goo of some sort, with a pile of bananas on top (a generous portion at least). It didn't resemble French toast in any way. A good example of ""improving"" on a simple idea until it becomes a disaster. I really should have photographed it because it was unbelievable. The flavours in this dish are supposed to be simple and delicious. Whatever this was ruined it.

By all means, come for lunch and dinner. The burgers are excellent, the steak pie is amazing, and the server is lovely. One of my favourites. You also can't believe the value. It's still one of the least expensive diners in town. But skip the breakfast as the chef seems bored with it and is trying to overcomplicate it.

Earlier review below:

Returned for dinner and enjoyed a wonderful steak and mushroom pot pie with a lovely flakey pastry crust. The service from Gurneet was friendly and welcoming.
The food was not good. Everything was incredibly bland. I had the salmon sandwich, and it was overcooked, dry, and underseasoned.  My wife had fish and chips that were incredibly underwhelming.  Fries had no seasoning at all. Food was just bad. Low quality ingredients and poorly executed.
My partner asked for a long island iced tea, and our server basically just said no because she didn't know how to make it. Ummm... that's what Google is for.  Look it up! Make it happen. Her response just blew my mind as I could see all the ingredients on the bar shelf. Our server did go off shift before our meals arrived, and the girl that took over was about the only highlight of our entire experience.  The second server was quite pleasant, but it didn't make up for the awful food.
Needless to say we will not be back and I would recommend you just keep driving. Skip this place.
Kid you not Victoria, if you haven't tried their BBQ Bacon Cheeseburger you're missing out! Make sure to go down and get it as it's way better hot and fresh, and cap it off with a $5.50 Blue Buck :)

Whatever they've changed over the past year is working! Way better than most places in town, and the pakoras are absolutely bang on too!
Great service, great portions, and most importantly, great flavours. What more does one need? 10/10 highly recommend

My new favourite place in town to get vegan comfort food! Their chick‚Äôn club sandwich was the best vegan sandwich I‚Äôve had, you could taste how much effort was put into it! All their other menu items I ordered as well were delicious!
I‚Äôve had the double-decker breakfast sandwich (in an English muffin), an oatmeal-raisin cookie and the B.E.L.T. Deluxe, which was really good. Good food! Sometimes available are day-old muffins for half-price. Great place for food and hot drinks. Central location.
OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!

I don't know where to start. The girl behind the counter was very helpful. Made some great recommendations! We ordered the Spring Fog and Lavender Latte, both were yum üòã, and the Flower Power and Mocha muffin (also delicious!) and lastly the Garlic Cheez Bun and wow! That Garlic cheese bun was so good! So happy I got it
A nice little cafe like this should definitely be commended!

The food feels healthy (as it is!), the atmosphere is relaxing, and the coffee is actually great!

I was pleasantly surprised to find micro-greens here at a VERY reasonable price!

Thank you for helping us to stay healthy when we‚Äôre out and about!

No. I had to explain to the staff how to do the simple task of listening for what I want and getting what I want. Shouldn't be that hard, but none of the staff seemed to understand what you do when you work at a Tim Hortons.
Got order wrong multiple times even though it was simple. Very slow and seemingly nonchalant. Not one to write reviews but felt like I had to after that.
For 6 people working behind counter they are very slow,I waited 10-12 min for my order and it wasn't even what i ordered? But took it anyways because i was in a hurry,then there were junkies sleeping at the tables and smoking their crack pipe right outside the door bugging me for change,I'll never go back to that location
Not a great experience at this location. We ordered our drinks and breakfast sandwiches - no complaints there. Then we were sitting and waiting for our order, multiple people also had ordered and were waiting. There was a couple people behind the cash, and then one guy doing something with Timbits. There was no one at the station making food - mind you this was around 9:30am on a Tuesday morning. Finally I asked the girl at the cash, she looked around (don‚Äôt know how she wouldn‚Äôt have realized no one was there) and went to the back to grab someone.

A guy came out (with gloves already on) and proceeded to start quickly making the orders. Who knows what he was doing in the back‚Ä¶ his gloves should‚Äôve been changed as soon as he came out. Didn‚Äôt even get a chance to say anything since he was quickly moving to try and help the backlog of orders. I was definitely turned off‚Ä¶would not return to this location.
Very busy all the time. Washrooms were very dirty not impressed with that. But coffee was hot and had pretty much all of their regular treats and eats. There was a line up to get inside but it went by pretty quick. I was able to find a seat to eat my meal and have my coffee.

Great and kind servings, and cozy and comfy atmosphere. The lady owner welcomed me and my wife for our first visit and gave a nice explanation of the menu. And the barista served awesome coffee, soup and Bibimbab which is one of Korean traditional meals.

Nice place and cozy atmosphere. I had Caffe Mocha and spicy chicken wrap. It was really good. I love latte art!

The drink menu is extensive which is great for someone like me who can't have caffeine or dairy. Still lots of options for me! On this visit had their strawberry acai cooler which was great.

While the branding and furnishings are nice, it does feel more like a hole in the wall to get ones food to go rather than sit and eat. Though they do have a few tables it's a bit cramped and cluttered feeling. Maybe a slight redesign of the layout would help? Still, great spot for a breather while shopping, or to stop by and take something to the waterside. And the food more than makes up for the lack of ambience.
The honey glazed pork bao was simply amazing. I‚Äôm the best bao I‚Äôve ever had and definitely loves up to its reputation. Great value for the small price. Packed with pork, cucumber and cilantro. Lattes are delicious as well, will definitely be back!

Food and staff was amazing. The place has a  relaxed cozy feeling to it, it's perfect for brunch. Our doggo got its own home-made treat which made us feel even more at home. Definitely becoming a regular here!
I love the location of this little breakfast joint. They are located in old China Town and there is a lot of history in this building. There are photographs and write-ups behind plexiglass in the covered walk paths from one side of the courtyard to the next explaining the history of this area.
The architecture is fascinating as well.
This eatery is walk to the counter, order and pay first...then sit and they bring your food to you. We ordered the gluten free biscuits and gravy and requested extra care, as this food choice is allergy induced, not a lifestyle for us.
They were great about asking clarifying questions and I felt confident they understood our needs.
We both had waters and I appreciated that they left a bottle with us to refill ourselves, as I drink a lot of water. My husband had chai and I had a london fog. My London Fog was delicious and probably in the top two or three I've ever had.

The biscuits and gravy were on the small side, but filling. If you have a big appetite, I suggest a double order or get a side or oatmeal or something to go with it. The gravy was a vegan, mushroom gravy and was a touch too salty for me, but otherwise good. The biscuits are typical gluten free...sandy more than soft like a biscuit could be. I can make them at home that way, but home was a long ways away while we were here, so I'm happy to have the choice. Unfortunately, for someone allergic to gluten and eggs, there is little else to be had on the island that I found.

The cafe interior is cute, with multiple small seating areas. The washroom is tiny, but efficient and ungendered.
Love this place!! Definitely one of my favourite places to have brunch. Food is always delicious! They specialize in making the best biscuits. Worth trying!!

It looks like a family run business as I see the same people working there. And they are the nicest people!

Overall, whenever I come to Shanzee‚Äôs I have this feeling of being at home.
Very comfortable and homey with friendly servers. My wife thinks of herself as an expert on biscuits and gravy and said these were the best she‚Äôs ever had. My omelette and hash browns were excellent and well prepared.

Pretty good coffee! I got the ‚ÄúGraham Cracker‚Äù specialty coffee and it tasted like the pumpkin spice latte from starbucks. Overall, pretty good. The cinnamon is not too overpowering.
Their espressos are really great, but they only had expired coconut milk, which made me question why they even offered it instead of throwing it out and buying fresh? We opted for oat milk both times we went, and it was probably the best dairy-free coffee we had in all of Victoria. It was a shame one cashier in particular was so churlish, but it made for a humorous story back home.
We had come in the store when it was really busy. I was expecting the employees to be a little on edge. But they stayed calm and got everyone drinks ready in fairly short amounts of time considering there were a lot of people there at the time. I would 100% come back again. BTW their London fogs are amazing.
The best half sweet almond mocha!
Friendly staff and a beautiful barista who‚Äôs latte designs are perfect!

The breakfast sandwich is made of buttery, savoury biscuits which are delicious. Took some cinnamon buns to-go: very tasty (almost as good as my mom's... but that's a high bar). Reasonable prices. Solid place - check it out if you're in the area.

*Note: Bubby's bun is the left one in the pic; I did a ""cinnabun-off"" against the Sally Bun, and I have a slight preference for Bubby's (although both were good).
I‚Äôve been here a dozen times with friends and it‚Äôs always enjoyable. They have amazing mochas and it‚Äôs what I usually get. Their croissants and breakfast sandwiches are definitely worth the try if you‚Äôre looking for something savory. All of their desserts are delicious. They are also open pretty late which can be nice after work/school.
Great little place with indoor and outdoor seating. Good selection of vegan food for a light meal. Terrific coffee as well.  Say hi to Esteban as you walk in. I enjoyed the vegan chili w a gluten free bun.
Absolutely yummy baked goods! Vegan options available too. Our favorite was the caramel apple crumble and chocolate shillings. The chocolate quinoa sandwich was great too.
Decent gluten free sweets. Their gluten free cheesecake is yum, though could be a bit less sweet so I won‚Äôt be back too often for it. The gluten free pizza is great to have as a reasonably priced ready to go meal even if they only have one kind and it‚Äôs veggie. Cute atmosphere and friendly staff. I wish they had more savoury gluten free things.

Thank you for your feedback. If we visit Victoria again, we will stop by and give it another shot. It must be good because there's always a line. It just wasn't my lucky day.

We were so excited to try this place and in the morning we headed out. The place was late to open and we got there while the tables were being put out. We ordered and the waffle dough wasn‚Äôt ready so we had to go with something else. It was not the best. I make better ones at home. Sadly we were not impressed and I was so excited about going there.
The best Belgian waffle I ever tried in Canada. Tastes very authentic. They are served exactly like in Belgium, fresh, warm, rich and sweet. Amazing!
The best waffle shop in Victoria, almost every one knows about them. The shop is in a very nice location at market square where you can check out other stuff around too. One star off because the staff wasn‚Äôt so friendly when we visited recently but overall, they got delicious treat, even the plain one with no chocolate sauce or whipping cream, quick and nice service most of the time. I will always go back here for waffles
Awesome waffles! Best waffles in have had so far! This was the highlight of our trip to Victoria. Cozy little place in the market square. Looking forward to visiting again!

The best food and drinks.
Atmosphere very cozy.
Staff actually call you by your name they make you feel like family here.
And very much on top of cleaning  off tables as soon as customers leave this beautiful little  GEM OF A CAFE.
If you have not been here ,you must I insist
A Quaint and lovely space. Has indoor and outdoor seating. Beautiful looking food! Very appealing and delicious food. Usually I found little bistros/cafes like this don‚Äôt have enough variety or enough meal-type food more-so just snacks, and I‚Äôm left leaving hungry. But they had a great variety of delicious food like polentas, salads, sausage rolls, and incredibly yummy desserts. I will definitely go back.
In July, Mark catered a wedding reception for 140 people in our garden. Where to start with this? well, the planning of this event was complicated - at least from our point of view. For Mark, nothing was a problem - he looked after everything from food to  beverages, ordering of tents and tables and chairs - every detail was thought out and executed perfectly.
The food: fabulous, as the food from De'lish always is, and it just kept coming. The staff was professional, courteous and experienced...and somehow, unobtrusive. In the weeks following we have had many unsolicited comments from friends about the food and service - rave reviews, in fact. Thanks Mark - you were a very important part of this celebration.
The food was great. Now, the customer has to negotiate a very small ordering area to be able to get cream, sugar etc. Not very easy when the place is busy. Another cream and sugar station outside, where most people are sitting, would be a good addition. Paper plates instead of paper boxes would be better especially when you stated to be eating on site. Ceramic dishes‚Äìeven better. Wood sticks to stir hot drinks is just not worthy of a fine place like that. Also proper metal cutlery would be welcome.
They would save the earth a bit more efficiently if they would wash the utensils instead of using disposable stuff.
Maybe, it's due to covid measures and if that is the case I hope they go back to proper cutlery. It's a very nice and attractive place with great food apart the inconveniences.
Stumbled on this little gem today. Amazing food and Pastries. The soup was delicious. The staff we're very welcoming and friendly. They also have a great selection of prepared meals to take home. Will definitely be back.

ChIJJbbavu91j1QRjdqx1wmwq60,Bubby Rose's Downtown,4.0,48.4276152,-123.366952,53,"Met a colleague for a business meeting here for my first visit last week.The staff are very kind and friendly. The atmosphere is totally not pretentious. Tables are quite small. Makes for a socializing but not the best for sitting down to discuss business, and probably not enough space if you like to work for hours at a coffee shop, plus there is no plug to charge your device. The girl who was working at the time was very nice and help full, she even offered me to charge my laptop behind the bar (in their working area). The other comment I have is the ordering area. t is a little awkward if you have not been before. But hey, it's about the coffee, food, quality of service and ambience and they all definitely score high with me. I would visit again.
Food is tasty, though almost exclusively baked goods and sandwiches. Servers aren‚Äôt terribly helpful in this location and it‚Äôs not kept very clean.
I have to change my rating of Bubby Rose‚Äôs üòü I primarily would go to Bubby's for the espresso, and did really enjoy it. Good crema, shot volume, heat, etc...Alas, recently they decided to change the bean & roast - and it is no good. Why are decisions to change the espresso bean & roast made by people who don't understand(or value), produce, and drink great espresso..?! (I would also mention that Bubby's snack's and location are still great!)
So I continue my search for the best espresso in the land...simple process yet very difficult to produce, both on a 1-off basis as well as over time.
üòî
First off I am sure the owner will jump in and reply to this negative review (see my post below for why) so I‚Äôm just going to be honest and upfront‚Ä¶
This was our first and last visit to Bubbys, we live right across from them in a condo and we are so disappointed in our visit.
They asked if we wanted our sandwiches toasted and our pizza reheated up..
Absolutely we did so we said yes, what happened next shocked us both‚Ä¶
they microwaved our sandwiches and pizza- yes microwaved the sannies with lettuce, tomatoes, onions etc inside.
ü§¢
And the pizza, well holy moly‚Ä¶
What happens when you use a microwave to heat up meat and veggies in a bun with sauce etc‚Ä¶
The pizza, well hello gooey and goopy dough, just inedible.
Absolute mush and disgusting, the staff didn‚Äôt seem to care and said the owner will most likely say something if we posted our review online.
We mentioned how this wasn‚Äôt what we were expecting and they didn‚Äôt know how to reply they just said this is what the owners wanted down.
We threw away our food after one bite each and decided to not go back to any of the locations
The services wasn‚Äôt great but the food was shameful and an embarrassment.
Save your money and go elsewhere, trust me on this one.

Also, there is a post about this company on Reddit, wow, I encourage everyone to look it up on that site, there are over a 100 people complaining about this business ever since it changed hands in 2018.
What a shame.
I always thought the food was good enough, not outstanding but overall tasty!

The management however is unprofessional and sketchy (not paying staff on time or the right amount for example).

Anyone complaining about the service don‚Äôt blame the students working there.

Hummus and naan

Great tofu hotdogs too
And 2 pasta options available vegetarian.
Also great selection in meat sandwiches for who is interested.
The chef also informed me that infact the fruit salad is also vegetarian friendly. But sadly it is coming off the menu. ‚òπÔ∏è
Love this spot. The gelded steak and the Moe's burger are so good. Everything tastes fresh, lots of flavour. The berry aioli on the burger is interesting and delicious. Multiple glizzys on the menu too, the Shetl is legit.

Not to mention the staff. Very friendly and accommodating. Simple little eating area with funky old timey music. I wish I lived closer

Don't sleep on Papa Moe's!
This place is AMAZING. We got delivery, and the driver got a little turned around so it took a little longer to arrive, but it was still so delicious. The quality and care really comes through. The bread was perfect at holding my loaded Ruben together. 15/10 will go back!
So Good!! Can't wait to go back!  We ordered the Moe's Burger with curly fries, was very delicious and good quality, especially for only $13!  Service was super friendly and professional, place was clean and tidy, great vibes in there. See you guys soon!

Between me and my best friend, we ordered a cheeseburger, mushroom cheeseburger, regular fries and the Montreal smoked meat poutine, which was HUGE! They don‚Äôt cheap out here. The prices are very reasonable and have better quality and taste than the typical $16 burger you grab at a restaurant. I love how this place is literally just a random stand in a parking lot in a slightly commercial/industrial area.

Work lunch group wanted to try something new and found this place.  A small hole in the wall good truck.   Really good prices for what you get and I was very impressed with the food.  I also enjoyed getting a cup of gravy.   Made me laugh.   Definitely would eat again.
Place may not look like much, but the burger and fries I had were fantastic. A big menu which I hope to explore over the summer.
Food was okay.  Fries are definitely homemade and peeled before they are cooked. I saw boxes and boxes of potatoes.  That's what made me stop in the first place.  The hamburger, although advertised as homemade, doesn't look like a fresh patty of cooked hamburger.  Both items tasted fine.  Not sure I'd go back unless it was for my mom to taste the fries.  She's always looking for good freshly peeled homemade fries.  The stand had continuous customers.  Some regulars as the owner greeted the people by name.
I have recently visited this gem!
Fast food at incredibly low cost.
So yummy as well.

As for the food, the chicken dumplings were absolutely delicious. The filling was flavorful and the wrapper was cooked to perfection - not too soft or too chewy with a little bit of crunch. The chicken teriyaki was also cooked to perfection, with a sweet and savory sauce that complemented the tender chicken perfectly, nice to have it on a rainy day

Overall, I had a wonderful experience here. The food was excellent and had the home cooked feel to it. I'd definitely recommend giving this a go, if you're in the area
Amazing and Authentic food. Mom does it all on her own.

My friends and I make this spot a regular go to when we are in town. Great flavours and just the right amount of food.

Teriyaki chicken and teriyaki beef
This was a nice finding inside the shopping alley. A mix of Korean and Japanese cuisine. Not those elaborate menu options but selective items and all for 12$ each was a good option to go for. Served in cardboard boxes with plastic spoins and recyled wooden forks. We ordered fried Dumplings (actually Korean Mandus), Bulgogi, and Chow-mein‚Ä¶ my little daughters loved dumplings and chicken and beef pieces in them. For parents, it was a little bland. More flavors needed. Probably they have adapted dishes to Canadian palate? But I know Canadians love spicy food too. Isn‚Äôt it? I forgot to take pictures of the food we bought, so I don‚Äôt have them in my review. Anyway, it was an okay-okay hot food option on that sunny yet windy-chilly afternoon. So we won‚Äôt whine about anything. All good. Ladies taking orders and cooking were nice and gentle people.
We ordered weekend special. The food is amazing. Quality of food is great. Felt like eating at home. Highly recommend
A cold chill blows through Victoria, it's 11am on a Saturday, and I walk up to Mom's Kitchen. I order the shrimp udon and wait, watching the bustle of market square. I ate my soup under cover, watching the raindrops drip from the dips in the canopy. Steam billowing from my bowl. This was very wonderful udon. Would reccomend to anyone who wants to get food, but also brought their dog and can't go inside. This warmed my soul üíñ

The meal wasn‚Äôt just take-out, it was an experience that just kept happening.  When i felt that urge to tap out, there was more experience to be had.  I eat a lot of burgers, mostly my own concoctions.  THIS was better than my cooking and i gladly admit to that.  Grade-A, top-shelf food.  Fantastic work Bin 4!

Don‚Äôt forget to tip your server or the person taking the payment - most places are tip sharing so it goes to everyone.  TIP at LEAST 20%.
Best gourmet burgers in Victoria! A group of us (around 20 people) went, and had a fantastic time with great burgers. Bin 4 serves quality and quantity. The burger set meals (burger + sides) are worth the money. The meat is well seasoned and well cooked. The meat was moist (not dry at all), and had the juicy succulent flavor.
Recommended:
Bin 19: The big dipper (meal filling enough for a full meal).
As sides, I had fries and Bin 4 house salad. I would prefer fries and onion rings. The house salad is a regular salad, and wasn't the right fit for me.
Overall, a place that serves great gourmet burgers and has a great vibe! Last but not the least, service was awesome, kudos to the ladies for being prompt.
Great place to visit if you love burger and fries.
They has options for both vegetarian and non vegetarian burgers.
Onion rings is must try!
Staff is friendly and service is good.
Recommend to book reservation on weekend evenings.
Good to visit in happy hours as any burgers are usually 11$ if we order alcoholic drink with it.
Large seating options with big heated patio available.
Ample parking available.
One of the best tasting burgers in town. If not THE best. I was surprised with the garden salad. It had a hint of sweetness. Very enjoyable place. Nice seating outside as well. Friendly waitresses. I'd go back ! Baby friendly ! Was a great day in the sun. Lovely just lovely
Late night special of 50% menu-priced burgers (with the purchase of a drink) after 9pm was the main draw!

Plating was a big thumbs up from me, considering it‚Äôs just a burger and fries! That being said, for a restaurant with a primary focus on burgers, the food was mediocre. Definitely better burger stops all over town. A few of the ingredients were over-cooked, including rock-hard bacon and dry onion rings. While the portion size is generous, the quality doesn‚Äôt seem up to par. The beer menu was decent, but the bar classics fell short.

Would come back here just for the late night special and the hangs, but it‚Äôs not to be construed for a premium burger restaurant. Worth mentioning that they were absolutely packed, so although that meant minimal service attention, it‚Äôs definitely a popular spot!

So much flavour without being too spicy. Great gluten free options. I ate the rice pudding too quickly to take a picture, and the same was for my partner and the Om Ali. The couple who made our meal were the sweetest people, I felt like we were ordering from family. Will absolutely be going again %100.
We tried Lamb Shank, Kofte, Chicken bowl, and the rice pudding. Everything was great! Lamb shank was so tender. The owner was very polite and helpful.

It is a take away restaurant, we didn‚Äôt know at first and asked the owner if there is dine-in available, the owner went above and beyond to accommodate us and arranged seating for us.

Everything here tastes good! Would try kunafe next time :)
I have never before seen a place on Google Maps with 5 stars; Mama Nadia's wildly deserves this unprecedented rating. You pick up your food from the side door of a community centre, where two eager children saw me circling aimlessly in the parking lot of the Circle K and guided me to the right door. The portions are family-sized. Order food to share with others or eat for lunch at the beach tomorrow. Maybe a few lunches - the portions are very generous for the price. We had lamb shanks, macaroni bechamel, & a very tasty baba ghanuj.

Do whatever it takes to keep this food home business alive - it has a comfortable and lived-in flavour of entrepreneurs sharing their talents that you will want to keep in the community for years to come.
I loved the in-depth flavours of the food. Service was high quality and I‚Äôm definitely coming back for more food every week :)
We were in town visiting/vacation. Took a chance based on the reviews and all the praise is definitely deserved! It was a little hard to find but we were greeted by the some of the friendliest people I've ever met. They helped us decide on meals and threw in a small dessert. I too had the lamb shank and my wife had a pasta type dish and both were exceptional! I can't recommend this couple/Mama Nadia's enough. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed!

Awesome food. Had the chicken croquettes and sausage sandwich. Great taste and prices!
Friendly staff, interior nice, nice little decoration and Brazilian music, I took a little bit of time, all the Brazilian specialties to taste as well as a fresh fruit juice which was passion fruit. Really excellent. The small bites were very good too. Too bad it won't be open in the evening, I live nearby but I work from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. every day, I will never be able to go there on weekdays since the opening hours are quite limited... tables and chairs to make a small terrace would be a plus, too bad there is no caipirinha either üòÖ (you can't find any in town, it seems to me).

It was during the opening phase, so well, i let that one slide. You know all new staff for a new restaurant, you've gotta wait a bit for them to work out the kinks. I've been back for dinner and brunch a bunch more times, and I've had amazing experiences. The atmosphere is really nice and relaxed. Food is really great as well, lots on the menu, obviously all vegan, diverse comfort food menu. Service has always been great as well. Love the pink painted duct work.
I'm not vegan but always happy to eat vegan. I've eaten at a handful of vegan places and this one has been my favorite so far. I had the ginger beef bowl and cashew mac and cheese and they were both great. Good portion sizes too.

Our server was also very good and we loved the atmosphere. Not too dark and not too light

I will be going back here for sure
Food was pretty good. Only reason not giving a 5 star was because our 'burgers' were a little burnt to a crisp on one side. Not sure if it was meant to be cooked that way or not. Also their cocktails were bit pricey for the size of the drink, but we're tasty none the less! Will definitely come back to try other things on their menu! Everything sounds delicious and we've gotta have a taste. We like the ambiance in there. Cool lighting fixtures. Awesome old school tv in the front playing VHS tapes. They were showing Willowwhen we arrived! Lots of pop culture art work on display also!
I've been three times so far. Large menu! Pesto chikkin sammie - the chikkin curls and fresh focaccia are great. Cronut stuffed with coconut Bavarian creme - decadent! Classic Benny - very good meal with two English-muffin halves, hash-brown potatoes and green salad. Comfort Bowl daily special was good and included a Beyond patty and a vegan ‚Äúfried egg.‚Äù Good spritzers and lemonades. Sometimes I find the music too loud.
Meet is a very interesting place. First off they do not serve any meat products, The food is loaded in flavor and vibrant in color, and alive. My employer said it is the best vegan Burger he has ever had, every place he's been. My meal was spectacular. No words could explain. I ordered the big yum. That's exactly what it was, very delicious. Yum yum yum. I'm definitely gonna go back and I want to bring a date this time There are a lot of people in the city who are missing out Well worth the wait Just stay in line do not leave. You won't regret it.

It's a reasonable place to take someone for a date- however not too intimate, pretty casual for a setting.

Date dinner with the Hubby almost a month ago (haven't reviewed), didn't know it was two for one appetizer Saturdays. OF COURSE we ordered the two-for-one! Why not? It's there, if it wasn't something we enjoyed, we didn't have to order it or come back, so there was nothing to lose.

Had no regrets on the selection; ordered the wings with Apple BBQ flavour, and the calamari. Be warned, the calamari does have some spicy kick to it- and I like spicy. Still delicious. Wings were crispy, even with the sauce- just a personal preference.

For the entrees my husband ordered the Halibut burger - but somehow ended up with the two-piece halibut fish and chips- he went with it, and didn't have any regrets. The batter wasn't overly thick, and the fish was thankfully not dry. My own order was spicy prawn tacos, and they were lovely. nice, light, refreshing. It comes with a side, but thankfully I chose this, because the appetizers were filling enough. The fries were nothing remarkable, but I did enjoy them.

We arrived around 5:30pm, to which dinner was just getting started- the tables were about 90% full, and our food still arrived at a ""reasonable time"" (we were in and out in an hour, without rushing our order and dinner).  The atmosphere was overall good; didn't feel rushed, didn't feel like we were inconveniencing anyone when we asked for refills of our drinks. I will, of course, come back again. Even for a somewhat price-conscious person, I'm very satisfied with my visit.

Highlights for me:
Accessible washroom
Two-for-one Appetizer Saturdays (excluding a few items)
Easy parking
Good service and food

Take note:
No dog patio
We sat in the patio and had a pilsener and an apple cider while we waited for our Caesar salad and halibut fish and chips. The food was great. some of the best fish and chips I'd had. I'd recommend a bit more dressing on the salad but the fried capers that it came with were a nice touch. Our server was attentive but not over bearing. Would go again.
Loved the food, great place to bring our young kids. We saw a couple otters on the ramp on our way in and out. Service was OK but thinking back, maybe under staffed. Atmosphere was good, next time we will probably request to sit on the flight deck with patio.
Found this place while wandering aimlessly around Victoria. We loved the name and decided to give it a try. It was a little busy, but the hostess gave us the option to sit at the bar. I'm so glad we did. The Otter has an excellent drink selection, including local brews. We split an order of poutine (IYKYK) that was absolutely fantastic! We loved watching the activity on the docks as we ate, including one seagull that liked to look in the windows to see what people were eating.

The staff were amazing and friendly from the jump. They also worked incredibly well together, anticipating what others needed, which increased the level of customer care and service. They elevated the experience tenfold.
Nice harbour side restaurant. It was very busy, so booking is recommended. We were lucky. Does some great fish and chips, you could have halibut or cod. Both were good,the code
a little cheaper.

There‚Äôs not a lot open late in Victoria so this is a good option for a decent selection. The rare steak was very good, the truffle fries were really good. The rest was just OK.

The new truffle ravioli was disappointing and I got it with the prawns but they were pathetically small and underwhelming (not worth the extra $). The ravioli was good but felt a bit undercooked, the sauce was a bit watery and didn‚Äôt adhere to the pasta well.

The Cajun chicken was tasty and not dry, the ribs were a little dry. It came with potato salad which was kind of bland.

The atmosphere in here is nice and decent service! Good location, but if you‚Äôre driving since it‚Äôs downtown you need to take a bit of time to park.
we did not book a table, but on Saturday evening they found a free place for us. Very attentive waiters. We ordered spring rolls, spinach - very tasty, beautiful serving of the dish. The only downside to this place is that the music is very loud....
First time visit while in Victoria. The main attractive part is the fact that they are open late and serve food late in the night. Tried their Happy Hour menu and everything was great. The drinks (Mojito and Mai Tai) did not disappoint us at all.
We will be back to try their Brunch menu soon.
Everything was great as usual. I just wished they wouldn‚Äôt take away the shrimp spaghetti. It was a personal favourite and alot of other customer‚Äôs too (as I overheard).
We had reserved the private room for a bachelor party however the restaurant double booked it so we could not sit there.  The manager did give us 2 bottles of Prosecco to make up for it.  The food was good but really high price $55 for a steak is crazy for a franchise restaurant.  Service was ok.

I enjoyed the churro to finish off the meal as well. The restaurant is relatively new , nicely decorated, and very clean. Service was also good. The 18-28% tip range option on the POS machine is a joke though; please adjust to a more reasonable range or just increase your prices by $1-2.
Fast, friendly, attentive servers, delicious food. Highly recommend the volcano chicken or the honey mustard. I'm very glad to find an authentic Korean restaurant and I hope that you keep the food the way it is, don't listen to ignorant people who don't understand that different cultures have different foods. Delicious!
Been here several times already! The tastiest and moistest chicken I ever had! I also tried the churros and the k-toast, and they were quite good desserts. I‚Äòll definitely visit again üòÑ
I tried many restaurants in Victoria, but the food here was different. They serve delicious food(especially sauce)at reasonable cost. All staff members are very kind and helpful. Also, the restaurant atmosphere was comfortable and romantic. I highly recommend this restaurant and I will certainly visit again shortly.
This place offers cozy and luxurious vibes. I got a platter of roasted chicken( mix of boneless and traditional) and salad with cocktail. I was enthralled by how flavourful their chicken and salad were.
The cocktails were aesthetically pleasing, beautifully made with variety of colours and delicate flavours.
This place must be a hidden gem in Victoria and recommend to those who have been craving for good chicken plates.

Make sure to make a reservation so you get a great table.
We had the chicken and mussels,  I feel it was a mistake. Should have stuck with one theme. Either seafood. Or no seafood.
The chicken was very very good.
I‚Äôd have it again.
Great location. Cocktails are not worth it although they sound really good on the menu. Service was a miss. Took us about 30 minutes from being seated until we got our orders in and took a bite. Quite loud if seated indoors. Seafood charcuterie was bomb! We were starving and this was THE fix. Humboldt squid appetizer was also very good. Worth trying.
The cocktails are great!! And the fresh onions soup has cheese on it bread in it. The lamb is the best I've ever eatenÔºåvery soft and juicyÔºÅDelicious oysters and pastaÔºÅ Black forest Chocolate cake also üëç
A farm to table restaurant. We walked in on a Saturday night and were seating right away. The restaurant is very big. There was a section with a bar with a younger ground, another sections with larger groups and family and then another area that seemed to be more intimate. Everything that we ordered was delicious- gnocchi, lasagna, and pumpkin cheesecake. Highly recommend the pumpkin cheesecake (without the apple compote and lemon-those flavours didnt go well together for my palate) I would say it‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve had. Service was great. I would definitely go back!
Shared a lovely lunch with my daughter-in-love. The house made pate is a delight and we both had the duck which was crispy perfection!
Desserts are not to be missed - the cheesecake is next level and the tiramisu is outstanding!
Professional relaxed vibe. A perfect lunch - will definitely be back!

This is an authentic shokudo food. You should not compare to a pricey omakase, but you can expect comfort and satisfactory meal. The grilled sockeye collar and the mackerel were wonderful. We are happy to try this place during our visit.

The only complain that I have was the rice, which could be better.
This was hands down our favorite and best find in Victoria. We ordered a tuna and salmon lunch, and picked it up the next day to eat at Philips brewery.

Since they are not doing dine in currently, you have to order the lunch the night before online at ~7PM, and then pick it up the next afternoon. We actually got a little lost looking for it, but loved the experience searching for it.

The food itself was fantastic - loved the shredded egg, thought that was pretty unique touch, and the sashimi was fresh, thick and just all around amazing. Would recommend this place to anyone!
If you miss the pre-COViD uchida and have avoided supporting them or leave a low star rating because there is no dine-in option‚Ä¶ you are missing out on this gem. I was a long time customer who had his early dates (with my now wife) here.. always loved going there for their dine-in experience.  I am guilty of not going in the last couple years because of not wanting to takeout the amazing food in portable packaging.  I ran into the chef socially in the last couple months and kept saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôll see you soon‚Äù.. but today I really pushed myself in using their online ordering system and picking up takeout for a car date with my wife. The number of times I kept saying ‚Äúwow‚Äù as I sat in my car holding the paper box‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs astounding how much care and love the chef puts into this food. For it to taste this good even in a portable form.. I am embarrassed now to feel that I was waiting for them to resume dine-in to go support this amazing eatery.

Please experience Uchida and let this chef express this talents.  As of this review in Nov 2022, you do you have to order online and pickup at their door.  Trust me, it‚Äôs not the same takeout food you are used to. I ate every grain of rice, not to waste a single element of the meal made personally for me.
Yasu is an amazing chef and I love how the fine ingredients are picked from local, sustainable sources. Takeout is still the only option and ordering is online only done in advance. I couldn't grade atmosphere since dining is not an option but the entr√©es are made with lots of care and love. Menu does change periodically so keep an eye out for variety.

Today I lucked out with chicken curry and onsen eggs. I've always heard about onsen eggs but not locally so it was a delight to drink some. Do we even have an onsen in Victoria? üò≠ If there's a legit Japanese one sprouting out somewhere here, let me know because I am game for that!

Such a fresh and delicious spot for a healthy bite to eat! I like that I can build my own bowl and that it‚Äôs a locally owned restaurant.
Not the best poke spot. I found the marinade a bit too heavy and the wasabi mayo was so overpowering I couldn‚Äôt finish my food. Service was friendly and prompt however and the place has a decent amount of seating and a nice vibe.
The rice bowl uses the wrong kind of rice. It should be warm brown sushi rice but it‚Äôs dry long basmati instead. Not enough sauce on the food at all and I had to bring my meal home and put salad dressing on it to eat it. Makes no sense.
We go here often and 90% the staff is really nice and helpful. The gentleman that served us today was still friendly after a long long day at cook st days. thanks again

The food was excellent, and the service was amazing. Great food and low prices. What more could you ask for.

We went there for lunch one day and breakfast another day. Both meals were perfect and under $20.

Be sure you plan extra time to walk around the building and see all the beautiful stained glass windows.
We really had an amazing experience here. Food is great at amazingly low prices. From entrance to exit all are super organized, really appreciate. Would love to come again. I visited for breakfast and lunch as well on different days, it was fun !! Never expected food to be that good.
To my Mom and I went for a lovely lunch.  We had a lovely server Pilar. We loved our server, the decor, the food was yummy, the setting was very nice , white table cloths, a Christmas tree and Music, white china, heated plates, we enjoyed the fact that we did not feel rushed to leave. The prices were great. We have booked for 2 weeks from today so we can try another menu item.
I had breakfast there a couple of days ago while visiting visiting Victoria. Both the food and service (so professional!) were very good. Prices were extremely reasonable - excellent value!  I wish there were more places like that. It‚Äôs nice to sit at a table with proper tablecloth and special tableware designed specially for them. It was a lovely experience.
As always, today, July 21st, 2022, the experience, the menu selection, the service, not to mention our blueberry pie dessert which we shared,was amazingly good! I‚Äôd highly recommend this breakfast/ lunch restaurant that might be one of Victoria‚Äôs best kept secrets. You are checked in through security, so bring your photo ID. Before you even eat, you wind your way through the basement corridors with painted brick and stone walls, of the Parliament buildings, going out one door and into another before arriving at the beautifully decorated Tudor style restaurant. Servers are prompt and friendly‚Ä¶food is delicious and best of all the prices are very very reasonable. You can check the specials of the day on their website. You will need reservations about 48 hours in advance, especially during the busy tourist times.

Lots of light and fresh decor. Full range of vegitarian and vegan food selection. The 'Rueben' was made with marinated tempeh and beets - deliciius. 3 Sisters enchiladas very good. Andrea came by to see how the food was. üòÉ
So glad we tried Rebar while in Victoria! The waitress was happy to point out the many gluten free & vegan options. The portion sizes are great. You won‚Äôt leave hungry. Lots of fresh flavours and veggies in the dishes. It would also be worth it to go just for the fresh juice. Delicious - it really hit the spot!

I think they were battered in the katsu breading. They were super crispy on the outside and perfect with everything else.  I'll go back here and can't wait to do it and try other stuff.
Great Place. Love burger here. Will try Kastu next time. They looks very delicious.
Too crispy donkatsu, salad mixed with delicious sauce, and French fries!!
Everything is perfect. üëçüëç

Amazing food and Great service.
Everything was really good.
I got the cheese katsu set. Wow. The Katsu was moist and a generous portion for the price. Loved dipping the salt and Wasabi with the cheese.
Probably the best katsu I've had in Canada.
Highly recommended! üíØ
Staff were so friendly and attentive -- felt like they really care about the business and the guest experience. Atmosphere was cute and very casual, we went around 3pm and we were the only ones in there. Cheese katsu was a large portion and perfectly crispy with gooey cheese.  I really liked the cabbage salad it came with. The bulgogi burger was sooooo messy but pretty tasty. It reminded me of a smash burger. One thing I will mention is everything had an element of sweetness (Katsu sauce, salad dressing, burger sauce) and wasn't balance by salt or spice. Would like to see more balance. Will definitely come back for takeout.

Very good Vietnamese subs,. Friendly people. Got #9 lemongrass chicken, #5 cold cut special, I did find the flavor of both of these exceptional.
Just tried 2 (of the 4 available) vegan bahn mi options at Bahn Mi Ba Le downtown and would 10/10 recommend. We‚Äôve been searching for our go-to place and have experienced a couple flops. Not Ba Le - it was yummmmmmm so good. We had the tofu (#3) and vegan chicken(#11).

I enjoyed the fresh and crunchy vegetables in the wrap. The flavours are exquisite. I love their aesthetics with modern flair.

Additionally, I also decided to try the turmeric cookie. Along with the turmeric, I appreciated the rose water. The rose water adds a distinct and unique floral which, in my opinion, is very unique. The cookie had a good texture, with a slightly crisp outer shell and a soft and chewy middle. Highly recommend. Next time, I shall order ahead.
Chicken Wrap with two extra falafel balls on the side. Definitely filling a niche that needs filled and I‚Äôm so glad it‚Äôs around whenever I need it! Thanks!
There is a reason this restaurant is always busy. So delicious!

I had a chicken wrap last week and it was not awful taste. It was full of cabbage and hardly find chicken inside though it was chicken wrap. Instead chicken I got too much fries.
Hope will take care next time.
Ordered the spicy falafel bowl for lunch. It took a bit of time but was worth the wait. Fantastic flavour and a good slow burn when finished. Add this to the go-to list for lunch! Next time I'll order ahead.

Seriously delicious. We were there early and the place was quiet, so the service was excellent. The food was outstanding, especially the gluten free bread on the sandwich and the Mezze in particular. I thought the tacos lacked a little punch and would have liked a touch more flair or flavour in them, but that in no way detracts from a well deserved five star vegan lunch. The roast potatoes were so perfect too. Yum! Excited to take my family when they visit.

A worthy mention - lovely staff that prioritize a comfortable dining experience above all. Thanks for the great meal!
Excellent Customer service. Took us in 15 minutes before our 630 appointment. The waitress was very friendly and kind. The food were amazingly plated. The smoothies were a treat. However I didn‚Äôt appreciate the spring burger and the sandwich we ordered. The bread and the veggie patty and tempeh were too dry for our liking. The buns were too crumbly, dry and dense. My excitement for coming back  here went down. Im pretty sure their other menu selections are tasty.
We came here as a date dinner and it was perfect! The tables were really close to each other but it made the atmosphere really cosy and magical. Beautiful restaurant and attentive service. We ordered the soup of the day that was delicious and their tacos, the sauce was good. We also ordered the green bowl which was good but nothing too out of the norm and a little bit bland. Their pickled vegetables are homemade and one of the best I have ever tried. Their cheesecake was to die for. I love the idea of having a seasonal menu as you can tell the produce is fresh.

I have been a regular customer at this restaurant and I've always enjoyed their delicious food and excellent customer service. However, my recent experience left me disappointed. I ordered the beef mango curry but received plain beef curry without any mango. When I returned to the restaurant for a replacement, the cashier claimed it had mango without even checking or tasting the food. I am disappointed with the lack of effort made to amend the mistake. The cashier simply insisted that the dish contained mango, despite my assurance that it did not. I felt that my feedback was not valued, and I was left without the dish I had paid for.
There are over a dozen other Indian restaurants between my home and Spice Valley Esquimalt, but I will make the trip here instead every time! The food is SO flavourful and wonderful, and the best naan I've had!! (I do miss the samosas though!)

Lo and behold, a container of crisp, fresh, finely shaved purple cabbage replaced the iceberg lettuce which used to come with this meal. Outstanding change! So crunchy. So good.
Their burritos are delicious...when you get a good one. I've had mostly good luck so my burritos were always pretty good. But unfortunately, sometimes you get a mushy flavourless burrito that just leaks liquid.

I'd give it 3.5/5 but I can't select half a star, so I will give the 4/5 since the owner is cool and friendly.
We had an event catered by La Taquisa and the whole experience was wonderful from start to finish. Food was delicious and Scott was so great to deal with. Really can‚Äôt recommend them enough.
Fantastic tacos, especially the beef ones. Service was fast and friendly. Menu clearly labelled with what contained gluten.
What a hidden gem ‚Äî this place is legit. I popped in for a quick bite just before lunch time and in the time I was there, every single customer that came in was a regular that the owner knew by name. The staff was speaking Spanish to each other which is always promising for a Mexican restaurant, they were all super friendly to me, and sure enough the pork chorizo burrito was mad tasty.

It‚Äôs a bit pricy at $14 for just a burrito, but worth it for a good meal and to support a local business that staffs and serves good people. If I lived in the area I‚Äôd pop in weekly, cause I know I‚Äôd get treated good!

I would recommend to just go with a full dish instead of the trio, you get more for your money. Finishing touch, a nice espresso. I will be back.
This place is awesome! Fabulous tapas, you can‚Äôt seem to go wrong with anything on the menu! Everything is perfectly curated. Beef carpaccio is love at every bite, same with gambas al ajillo.

Last week my burger was great, but today was not so good. Below is a picture of my ""Special"" beef dip for $15. Fries were extra for $4 which I didn't read because it was located in the top corner  of the notice board in smaller writing. I believe their other meals (from the grill) come with fries so you just assume it would, as did my coworker. Anyways, my plate comes and the beget bread is super thin and small. The beef dip has no taste and I'm thinking I ordered from the kids menu. My coworkers are amused so I ask the dish person if this came with fries, he said he would go check and never came back. At this point they were not very busy.  I had to ask him again and he said no. As I took a photo of my meal, the person operating the cash register noticed me, that prompted her to ask if everything was ok. I said, for $16 I thought this would have came with fries. She asked if I'd like some, so I accepted her offer which I was thankful for. When my coworker's meal came out, she order the same thing. It appears I received the end peices of the baguette where she received the middle pieces, her portion was twice the size with twice the amount of beef and came with large pickle. I'll be giving this place a break, if I return and the service improves I'll change the rating. Keep away from the specials.

I personally recommend the Caramel Chicken when visiting this place. Good luck!
The crispy ginger pork was an explosion of flavor in my mouth. I would definitely recommend it. The spice level was just right for me.

My wife got the famous caramel chicken which she enjoyed. Both dishes are delicious. The potstickers though were just average fried pork dumplings. Their meat serving  was plentiful that we had to ask for a to go box for some leftovers.

Prices were reasonable considering it already includes taxes. Service was fast.
What a gem! This is what you might call a ‚Äúhole-in-the-wall‚Äù treasure chest of a restaurant, given its humble appearance in proximity to just another liquor store‚Ä¶ but the food was divine! Some of the best spins on Thai classics I‚Äôve seen and tasted and I look forward to trying more. Not the most ‚Äúcozy‚Äù spot given limited space and seating, but perfect for a quick yet quality meal alone or as a pair.
We will be back for more!

Had passed by this place many times, and finally stopped!  Really glad we did.

The s&s pork Belly was really tasty - the green beans were sneaky good!  We also had a daily special - lentil dahlli - which was super good too!  The fry bread was a welcome appy, as it was a unique dish!

Parking is a challenge, but the walk is worth it.
Best food experience on our trip to Victoria!!
We ordered Kung Pao Tofu and Special Fried Rice, both the dishes were delicious. For Kung Pao Tofu, one would imagine that Tofu was the star of the dish (which it was), but for me it was the crispy fried broccoli which took the dish to another level.. chefs kiss !!
Food quantity and the service was pretty good. I can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu.

ChIJoyXLSuBzj1QRobxGFfZmA6c,L'Authentique Poutine and Burgers,4.8,48.4262488,-123.3702392,147,"Fast and friendly service. We ordered the kids burger and fries which is a steal of a deal. Excellent cheeseburger with fries, juice box and ice cream cup for $9.

We didn‚Äôt get the poutine sadly but we did order another small fry because these fries were arguably the best I have had in my life!

Definitely pop in for a bite!

With its inviting outdoor seating and cozy atmosphere, this restaurant provides a memorable dining experience that will leave you craving more.

I ordered the basic poutine, and I indulged.   A delectable combination of crispy golden fries, velvety cheese curds, and a generous smothering of savory gravy. The fries were perfectly cooked, striking the delicate balance between softness and crispiness, and the cheese curds melted in the mouth, imparting a delightful creaminess to each bite. The gravy, rich and flavorful, complemented the other ingredients without overpowering them. It was evident that the restaurant takes pride in the quality of their ingredients, as each component was fresh and well-prepared.

Moving on to the cheeseburger, L'Authentique demonstrated their prowess in crafting a classic favorite. The cheeseburger I savored was a testament to their dedication to flavor and quality. The patty, cooked to perfection, was juicy and flavorful, bursting with the unmistakable taste of quality beef. The cheese, melted to perfection, added a creamy richness that elevated the overall experience. The bun, lightly toasted, provided the ideal vessel for holding together all the delicious components of this burger. The combination of flavors and textures was undeniably satisfying, leaving me thoroughly impressed.

Moreover, the staff members were friendly and attentive, ensuring that each customer received personalized attention and a seamless dining experience. Their knowledge of the menu was evident, as they offered helpful suggestions and answered any questions I had.

In conclusion, L'Authentique Poutine and Burgers is a gem among outdoor restaurants. From their mouthwatering poutine to their flavorful cheeseburgers, every bite is a testament to their commitment to quality and taste. With friendly service and an inviting ambiance, this restaurant is a must-visit for food enthusiasts seeking a memorable dining experience.
I had a stop in Victoria from my cruise and I knew as soon as I stepped foot in Canada I had to get some poutine. Thanks to google maps, I knew just where to go. I made a beeline off the boat and headed here before the lines! Food came relatively fast, they made the poutine with fresh fries and topped it sopping with gravy. The man who handed me my order was so sweet and wished me ‚Äúbon appetite‚Äù.  As I sat there enjoying this plate of heaven the line go super long! As it should, this place was excellent!
Very nice service and knowledgeable about celiac disease. They fry corn dogs in a designated fryer so the french fries are gluten-free. You order at the window and eat outside. Parking is plentiful and you pay easily on your phone. Nice view of wharf.
We visit this little place at least a few times a year while out deck crawling in Downtown Victoria. The big draw is the authentic (it's in the name L'Authentique) Montreal Smoked Meat on the Poutine and Mechant Burgers. Best Montreal Smoked Meat I have had since I last went to Montreal. Very reasonably priced.

The bao buns we tried were Taiwanese Classic, Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Mala 5 Mushroom. The classic was the best flavour and it was just okay, the rest were bad. The Tan Tan Men was just bad, could barely eat it. And the Kara Miso Ramen was subpar, something about it was off. The Vietnamese ice coffee on the otherhand was yummy. You seat yourself and pay at the counter when you arrive, so there isn‚Äôt much service. Overall not nearly close to the 4.5 rating it has on google more like a 3.0.
Bao is my favorite place for Japanese fusion disk in Victoria. My favorite dish is Pork Belly Ramen with Extra-Pork Belly.

Pork Belly here are chrispy outside with softly inside during my first bite I feel OMG it great. Ramen soup, I have requirement as spicy as they can do. I love that because environment outside feel cold.

You should be trial if you travelling around Victoria downton, Yummy.
One of the few restaurants open late night on a weekday. Decided to try a couple of their baos during our stay in Victoria. Ordered Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Chinese BBQ, Mala 5 Mushroom, and the Taiwanese Classic (from left to right). It was 4 for $16. They were cute tiny baos, good for an appetizer and the flavors were on point. I wished they were full sized though! The Mala 5 mushroom had a good spicy kick to it.
LOOK NO FURTHER! This is the best place to eat in China Town, hands down! For starters, hubs and I are in our 40's, parents of teenagers, restaurant owners, and brought our large vacationing family to Bao from other blogger recommendations. We couldn't be happier that we tried it out!! Everything we tried was amazing, the 13 year olds loved theirs as well! Small, quaint, clean, fast, friendly, and absolutely delicious! We can't wait to visit Bao next time we go to Victoria!
I have been here a few times already and it‚Äôs a great spot for a really quick meal or snack. There are so many different options you can get when deciding what type of bao you want which is nice when you want to try different flavours! They also have other options like noodle dishes, rice bowls and starters that you can chose from if baos aren‚Äôt your thing. I‚Äôd recommend the Chinese BBQ Bao, it tastes very similar to Peaking Duck! Also the Mala Crispy Fried Chicken Skin is a must! This is what I ordered. For the Baos I got the Pork Meatball Banh Mi, Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Chinese BBQ and Tonkatsu Chicken. I also ordered the Truffle Chashu Ramen and
Mala Crispy Fried Chicken Skin!

ChIJSxhNq4V0j1QRWQF7bdTQRfY,Nubo Japanese Tapas,4.5,48.4277934,-123.3634267,1969,"I rarely provide 5 star reviews due to something always being off. Whether that be the food, service, or the environment. But this was impeccable. Very rarely did you find such fluidity and cooperation between serving staff and the kitchen.

The food was very delicious and surprisingly quick. Having fast service is usually a red flag for me, wondering if the food was fresh or made with quality, but without a doubt, it was made well.

Our waitress was very polite and nice to talk with. She always responded to our ""thank you"" with a ""you're welcome"" she had the perfect balance of attention and checkups to not annoy people with constant checks but didn't leave you wondering if you were going to be served. It was the perfect balance.

The restaurant is small, which does make the noise travel quite far, on the louder side, but being at the bar was a saving grace as volume seemed to be lower there.

All in all it was a very nice experience and the next time we are in Victoria we will definitely be returning for another meal.
Went here after a recommendation from a friend. I was happy with what I ordered but my folks were less so. Octopus was good, and the avengers roll was fantastic. The chicken kara-age was a miss. Overall, just okay.
Ordered outside our usual, sushi rolls, and it didn't disappoint one bit. Got some ramen and udon... Delicious! Drinks were also fantastic.  Only thing is, it felt crowded. Seating and table are all so close together. But doesn't take away from the delicious dinner we had.
Everything was perfection. To the rapid service to the quality of the food, thank you! The flavors and presentation are mind blowing üëåüèª‚ú®
Wonderful. Wow. This place comes highly recommended from family, friends, and strangers. It did not disappoint. The nigiri and sashimi was glorious.

Top fan of:
-hocate
-sake
-chutoro
-hamachi

We had the black Pearl roll which was also good.

Omg. It was great! Sashimi cuts were generous for the cuts.

Staff were all very friendly. Top experience here. I went for dinner last night and now debating it the next day for lunch.

Can‚Äôt wait to come back.

blackened creole chicken, it was delicious. We loved the mashed potatoes that came with it. We also got the tuna poke bowl, it was fresh and all the ingredients worked super well together. Excited to come again!
The food was absolutely amazing, especially the delicious Avocado salad. I tried Baja Fish Tacos for they very first time and it was a little spicy but incredibly delicious.
Everything was perfect.
One of the only places not short staffed. What a pleasure, the food was amazing and they couldn't do enough for us
First off, Nicci our server was awesome. The drinks, appys and dinner was amazing.
Thank for a nice evening to help celebrate our 29th anniversary. When making our reservations it asked if it was a special occasion l, and it was put in that it was our anniversary, so we were bit disappointed that there was no mention of it.
We celebrated my friend's birthday at Cactus. Our waiter was very friendly and patient, and the service was excellent. The atmosphere in the store is great and it's perfect for a small drink with friends. The food was delicious and we shared several dishes, but we loved Tuna Tatar the most.

ChIJ4_dRned1j1QRzLAgmt6Z3Rk,Tractor Everyday Healthy Foods - Victoria Harbour,4.3,48.4231353,-123.3681401,208,"Best local hidden gem in downtown!! This is a business that I would totally support any time. Best quality of food, fresh; healthy, and hearty! Friendly and knowledgeable staff, always welcoming and give lots of thoughts in preparing the food. Best part - their coffee and pastries. I love the dark chocolate pistachio cookies and the dark chocolate banana bread. come here every week we are in downtown
Exactly what we needed! Tasty, healthy, fulfilling food at a good price plus the location is perfect! I love that they have so many gluten free and vegetarian options that are not necessarily a salad, but full meals. We ordered a cup of lentil soup, chicken sandwich, Thai bowl with tofu and chocolate / pistachio cookies. The staff was really friendly
If your looking for a great healthy place to eat in Victoria this is the place!  They also have several Vegan options available!

We tried the Chicken Avocado Sandwich which was served on a Ciabatta Roll. We also tried the Nourish Bowl which comes with Power Greens & Brown Rice. You get the option to add two Market Sides to it. We chose the Edamame Crunch & Lemon Kale.

Everything was great. Plenty of indoor seating, also a great outdoor area as well that looks towards the harbor.

Pet Friendly Patio.
One of our overall highlights in Victoria. Everything is fresh and really high quality. The menu is a little limited overall, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. It's not a traditional restaurant. It has an upscale cafe setup but the food will leave you feeling very satisfied. The pear and pickled onions were so well incorporated into the chicken sandwich. They are flavor experts, where they can take items you normally wouldn't pair at home and make them extremely tasty. You can tell a proper chef came up with the recipes.
I'm only mad that I've been living in Victoria for 2 years and just now trying this place. I love healthy food, but I know it's hard to make it taste good. I got a yogurt Parfait and an everyday bowl with Quinoa and Blueberries. Every bite was packed with flavor and freshness. Staff were also very friendly and kind.

Lasagna was superb, but while the sauce was classic Italian, my preference is for a thick, deep red, flavorful sauce.  Very interesting location - you could eat inside of a mall-type setting or in a street view with full-height windows.
Zambris has always been a favourite restaurant. So, when my husband and I were planning our wedding, it was a total fluke that we were ordering takeout and then mentioned events. About a year later, we were hosting our small wedding reception in the atrium of their building. And as always, Zambri‚Äôs delivered on the food. From the antipasto, pizza and amazing cocktails to the drool worthy multi-course tasting menu. They nailed every dishes, each more delicious than the last. The crispy broccoli and panna cotta were especially a hit. Not a single guest went home feeling hungry. In fact, in the months since our wedding, our guests have raved about how amazing the food was. It truly stood out. In addition to the food, I have to mention the staff. They really went above and beyond. I never saw an empty wine glass. We had little ones at the reception, and the staff were so kind and patient. We can‚Äôt wait to celebrate our wedding anniversary for years to come at Zambri‚Äôs. This place truly holds a special place in our hearts.
The food was good, but it‚Äôs overpriced (as are the bottles of wine). They don‚Äôt give you any complimentary bread or butter, which is a little disappointing, although maybe that is standard these days? Finally, be forewarned that the dessert they advertise as a ‚Äúcookie‚Äù is literally a cheap wafer (not a cookie) with a single scoop of ice cream, and it costs $14‚Ä¶
Nice location serving well executed family friendly Italian eats. Dishes are very well portioned and the menu was simple. The fried brocolli was wonderful. Service was good and very unobtrusive. We enjoyed our dinner here.
Set partially in an atrium you have the atmosphere and acoustic, comfortable private setting.  Service and food was great.  The halibut itself was cooked to perfection, but as noted by the waitress it was the only seafood menu option.

The pricing isn‚Äôt for the faint of heart but the experience makes it more then worth it :)
Memorable experience diving in a beautiful sensorial exploration. Starting with an extraordinary cocktail called MOON + TIDE 18. (Suntory Toki, apricot brandy, lemon, koji syrup, cherry bitters, coniferous smoke) which kissed my senses - the prince in that fairytale style - and I woke up in a sunny fruit garden full of delicate smoke. I love it when food does that, first wakes you up the most wonderful way and invites you for a sensual journey, teleports you somewhere unreal and the only thing you can do is let go and explore: what an incredible melting beef short ribs, crispy outside yet wonderfully moist potatoe‚Äôs rectangle inside- carrot, salsify and kale. A side of duck confit rillettes style. Everything so perfectly baked. For wine pairing, the sommelier‚Äôs advices added to my journey, his second choice was a success. Each sensations in my palate had both more depth and space to develop. I caught myself slow down and focus on my senses. We concluded the journey with a brownie and beets which was very pretty and we loved the pate de fruits. Truly amazing restaurant. Thank you so much for the experience. The journey was exceptional. Very friendly staff. Memorable.
Yeah but the bill went to a little over 200 for 2 all included. Worth spending the money ? YES. ABSOLUTELY.
We ate here every day during our week at the Magnolia. Breakfast, brunch, and late dinner. Food was outstanding. Their hot sauce is l‚Äôade in house and is incredible. The compote was
fresh and delicious. Wonderful spirits and drinks for less than the stuffier Empress. Also quieter. More intimate. We were impressed!
Nice atmosphere, really good drinks provided by the best bartenders, Anton and Eric üëèüèº

From classic cocktails, the best fancy corn dog and one of the most unique cocktails I have ever had, the Mind Hive. Happy hour runs from 2 to 5.

Loved The Cortney Room.
One of the last fine dining establishments in Victoria, BC. By far the best experience I have had dining out here. From the ambiance to the expert gastronomic knowledge of the staff, to the decor and the food and drinks itself. Johnny our waiter, is the star of this place. Perfect for a special occasion to remember.

The taste was absolutely delicious, but they were extremely busy at 7 o‚Äôclock, the service was good but slow. You may need to wait for 20 mins for your next ribs.
The first rib will come with a sauce, 2 sides and 1 cake(?). After this, all of your refilled ribs will on its own. But make sure you ask for your next rib when you first rib on the table.
After a very long day, feeling exhausted and hangry we were met by our fantastic happy and enthusiastic server Alex who ensured we got exactly what we wanted to eat and completely lifted our spirits. She was very fast and had excellent customer service. The food was fantastic 10/10 would recommend!
We also went for all you can eat ribs. We arrived at about 7:30. The server was very nice. There were more people than usual, however the food came pretty fast ‚Äîabout ten minutes. Refill ribs took ten minutes as well. The ribs tasted normal, not too dry, a little burnt at the edges. Overall the dinner was pretty worth it.üëç
Great place to dine!!  Tacos are awesome!!!  Stakes are perfect!
And our regular sever is the best!!
Thank You Kathy!!!  She is always full of smiles and great help!!!
Want to give a shout out to our server Emma! She‚Äôs one of the reasons my wife and I come back to Montanas. We don‚Äôt live to far from the restaurant, and it‚Äôs a great place to go on those nights you just don‚Äôt want to cook. Good value for your money, and the food has been consistently good each time we‚Äôre here. But more than that, it‚Äôs servers like Emma who make our dining experience fun and memorable.

The food took a little longer as with the bill but the quality of service and food made up for it. The pasta was the best pasta I've ever had hands down. They make it daily, I had to eat it slow to savor every bite. We are visiting from Ontario and if you are in the area and want amazing quality food at good price, visit here during happy hour ( based on the time change it was dinner time for us anyway üòÇ).
A very nice meal at Lot 1. We started with a bottle of red wine and their Lot 1 Roasted Garlic Herb Bread ( March feature ) It wasn't what we were expecting as it's very similar to a deflated focaccia but it was tasty. For main, I ordered the Moroccan Chicken Rigatoni minus the red peppers, added extra cashews. Very flavorful, great portion size and a little bit of an unexpected heat. Finished the night off with the white chocolate cheesecake minus the raspberry sauce, maybe a little to much caramel. An excellent desert paired with a glass of red wine. Overall a great meal. Server was great, very tentative. Will be back.
We went here very famished and it didn‚Äôt disappoint! Our server was very friendly and accommodating. We had some complimentary snack and had my toddler‚Äôs spaghetti custom made! We left feeling full, satisfied and happy. Servings were huge and good for sharing. Good food and great service, highly recommended!
Great find for amazing pasta in Victoria!
I am so so glad that I decided to pop in here one evening. The range and quality of the pasta dishes is excellent - the bacon and mushroom ravioli was just outstanding.
Add to that a great selection of cocktails and the BEST brownies I think I've ever had, and Lot 1 Pasta Bar is an easy recommendation to make.
The venue is clean, tidy and appealing, and the staff are friendly and knowledgeable about their menu.
Thank you to all of the staff for a lovely evening and excellent food!
Very tasty pasta served in nice large portions so you will definitely be full and happy. Good happy hour deals including mussels, baked brie, and giant meatballs. The polenta bites are particularly tasty. All the pasta dishes tasted very fresh and the ravioli was particularly delicious. The downsides are that the pork belly was quite dry and they advertise fresh squeezed orange juice from real oranges but when I got served mine it was most definitely not fresh squeezed orange juice but boxed orange juice. As someone that regularly drinks fresh squeezed orange juice the difference is night and day. You can even see in the picture included that the color of the actual orange slice they added is completely different than the color of the juice they served which was opaque and tasted like a Tropicana variant. If it's not fresh squeezed, they can just be honest and put it in the menu as orange juice instead of ""fresh squeezed orange juice"" as it's false advertising.

ChIJMcsm4b10j1QRauM8NGbPGZ4,Heron Rock Bistro,4.5,48.4157681,-123.3756102,1049,"Came here based on Google reviews and we were NOT disappointed. Probably the best tasting Ceasar salad I've had in years. Falafel burger was super tasty as well.
My recent visit to this restaurant left me with some disappointment. The noise level inside the establishment was so high that having a conversation became quite challenging. It created an uncomfortable and chaotic dining experience.

Furthermore, the food did not meet my expectations. Specifically, the chicken in the chicken burger lacked flavor and tasted predominantly like bread. The absence of a distinct chicken taste was disappointing. To enhance the flavor, we had to request hot sauce to dip the chicken in.

While this restaurant has room for improvement, it's important to consider that individual experiences can vary.
We ate here 2 days in a row! It was convenient located in the heart of James Bay. Atmosphere was wonderful, menu items were plentiful and food was over the top! Live music twice a week people! Great little place to visit and will now be our go to place for eats!!!
I absolutely love Heron Rock! Best Chicken and Waffles Eggs Benny in town. Tucked away in James Bay with a warm friendly atmosphere and the loveliest staff, definitely worth a visit! I would highly suggest brunch, they serve all week until 3pm. Chefs Choice Triple Benny is a great way to explore the menu or for people who can't decide and like a surprise. The chef will make you three different Benny's of their choosing and it's been super yummy every time! If you're feeling like a Cesar or Mimosa, Heron Rock has a fantastic list of all kinds of Cesar's to try as well as their ""Manmosa"".
Friendly attendive staff, popular with the locals. Live music Monday night. Really good home made clam chowder and in-house made bun.

Inside the restaurant is romantic, dark, and moody: perfect for a date night, evening cocktails, or having an intimate night to yourself.  They have a closed patio as well as an open-aired one though unfortunately it wasn't open when I visited.

Leah was our server who was methodical in how she went about the steps of service.  Amy also stands out to me in her role as a support staff/host.  Overall, the staff were quality: laid back but also seemed to care for their work.

I came for a Sunday night dinner so regrettably, the pasta dishes weren't available reducing the choices in entree.  However, their rotating specials of the day were a nice addition ensuring greater variety.  This also implies they utilize seasonal ingredients and come up with new dishes in addition to the set menu-- probably more fun for the kitchen staff too!

I ordered their special of the day: Eggplant Parmesan ($26) which was delectable.  I loved the addition of roasted vegetables (including potatoes, broccolini, sweet peppers, and carrots) to brighten up the otherwise heavy dish.

I would recommend this place for those in Victoria and craving a good Italian meal with a charming atmosphere :).
We came here on a Friday night.
With a reservation, we didn't wait to get our table. The table was located on a loft, feel sorry for the servers who need to run up and down every time.
We ordered Arancini for starter. They were rispy but bland that I had to dip them into the vinaigrette that was provided for the buns.
I ordered full size carbonara. The portion was very generous, but it was very salty. Because it's big portion, I had to finish slowly. It got a bit dry when it got to the end.
My friend ordered a medium rare steak. It came in medium well. The gentleman was nice enough to take it back, replaced the dish, and took it off the bill. The second steak came as medium rare.
We ate dinner outside on a beautiful day. The evening can be chilly but we sat right under the heater. It was perfect! My husband had their beet salad and loved it. We shared some brussel sprouts and they were soooooo good...very crispy on the outside and very flavorful. We shared a pepperoni pizza and the meaty one (can't remember the name) Both were delicious but the meaty one had a nice spice to it. A great dinner to end the day.
A decent, but underwhelming restaurant. Stumbled in here by ‚Äúaccident‚Äù as it was on the way to another destination. Stopped in for a few beverages and some ‚Äúlate‚Äù night snacks and dinner. Overall, the experience was positive regarding the service. The food was a concern. Very underwhelming to put it politely. I‚Äôve certainly had better Italian food and the menu is quite generic, but you‚Äôll have a decent time here as long as your expectations are configured and set for something ‚Äúsafe‚Äù and run-of-the-mill. I‚Äôd say the atmosphere of the restaurant is probably the highlight and not necessarily the food or beverage.
We stumbled upon fiamo accidentally because the restaurant we were gonna go to was at full capacity when we got there. But have to say, it was well worth it! Super fun ambiance, we had the most kindest hostess, she was amazing, and the food OMG the meatballs were divine. We also got the Crab pasta and the roast chicken pasta, I liked the Crab one better out of those two, but both were very good and BIG portions! We even took half of it home. Check them out folks, It's well worth it!

The drinks and food were super fantastic but the service was EXTREMELY slow at every step of the process. There were lots of hosts hoping around clearing tables and such but we went almost half an hour without anyone checking on us and waiting for the cheque.
Would dine here again but the service could definitely be improved.
Silly us, we overestimated how warm it would be at night. Our food was amazing and the view can't be beat, we were just so cold even when they moved a heater close to us. The seafood platter more than feeds 2 adults. I had the top sirloin steak and it was cooked to perfection at medium rare. We were with friends and the other meals were steamed mussels and clams, fish and chips and pepperoni pizza. Everyone left full and happy. I'd say this was more spendy than many other restaurants in the area but totally worth it.
One of the best happy hour spots in Victoria.
Make reservations for the veranda seating facing the bay.
We went 2 times in a week for some happy hour bites.
Their menu is heavily focused on fresh seafood.  The steamed muscles were delicious, and enough food to keep is full for dinner as well.
In the summer during tourist season, this place can get packed.  Tourist centric.
Parking can be tricky, much easier to just walk if you‚Äôre in Victoria.
Dinner time was busy, be prepared to be waiting.  Beautiful waterfront view and food were delicious and healthy too. We had harvest bowl (V) and mixed seafood.
We had a great dining experience here with friends.  It was a busy Saturday night but we had a table that was off to the side overlooking the deck and it seemed quite there. Good food and good service.  We had the Tuna Poke Bowl, the Chicken Boom Boom Bowl and the Salmon Bowl. All were good!

This was the best all-around meal I've had in a while. The portions were more than expected...looking at you Puff Daddy...and the flavors were on-point. I will have continued dreams about the Japa Roll and the British Fish and Chips roll had a whimsically delicious spin. Our server was absolutely delightful and helpful with any questions we had. Nubo will absolutely be put on the must-go list for next time I'm out.
We were looking forward to our anniversary dinner here. The service was good. The seating was good. And if you like rice with a bit of fish flavoring on top, you'll love this place. We prefer a bit more fish in our sushi dinners. We ordered quite a bit with our tab over $100, and if there was more than 2 oz of fish between our two meals I'd be shocked. Lots and lots of rice, though. Did NOT look like the pictures. (Maybe it was because it was Monday and they ran out of fish from the weekend? Who knows. We won't be back to find out)

Overall experience: Meh.
The restaurant is beautiful, great location, lots of windows and natural light. Our server was awesome! The food was absolutely delicious and was made so quickly. When I visit Victoria again, I will definitely be stopping in here. Oh and the prices were really great too. 5 stars all around.
Had a great Birthday dinner with my friends tonight, friendly staff, perfect service and great food. The cocktails were absolutely amazing, everything was just so fresh and delicious.
THE absolute best Japanese restaurant in Canada. Great service, excellent cocktails and fresh, tasty food. Put it on your list! You won't regret it!

We waited at 5 and were able to be seated when it opened at 530 on a Saturday. I think we may have been one of the last groups in line that made it in immediately.

I had the burger, olives, asparagus brioche and for drink the Vieux Mot. It was delicious. All of it. One of the best burgers I‚Äôve ever had. The fries were yummy and very French traditional. I‚Äôve never had a salty brioche before but will now be trying them more at home. I loved it.

I can‚Äôt speak enough about how kind the servers were! I travel a lot alone with my daughter (5yo) and we love to go to fancy dinners together. However that usually means we get  turned away or side eye. It was absolutely not the case here and I really appreciated that! We both had a wonderful dinner ‚ù§Ô∏è
A relaxing and welcoming atmosphere. Friendly and professional service. Perfect and mouth-watering food. I had the steak frites with the fancy fries.  The fries had the most amazing texture I have ever experienced, and the steak had this delicious aged butter melted on top?! To die for.

I have been dining in this French Bistro for 20 years. The consistency of the food has not changed a bit. Great food , great service  and the owner Mark is a gracious host.  Hands down my favourite restaurent in Victoria. Try the French Onion Soup, and endive salad. You won‚Äôt regret it.
We decided to finally try Brasserie L'Ecole on our anniversary for nice French dinner. 30 minutes waiting out in the cold was not so fun but we heard that's how you get a table so we dressed warm at least. We were seated right away and our server was polite and friendly while answering our questions about the menu. We ordered French onion soup and Tortelloni as appetizers and Rock fish, Duck Confit as main. French onion soup was fabulous. Rich in flavor, plenty of cheese on the top. The rest however was not so impressive. Tortelloni needed a bit more sauce, rock fish was cooked properly but was way salty. Duck confit tasted like a leftover most likely because it's overcooked. Not too long ago we had really nice duck confit at Cafe Brio so we were definitely disappointed. Dessert was alright, nothing impressive. After telling our server the rock fish was too salty, he took care of dessert which was nice. Personally I would prefer getting a great food and paying the right price for it than getting it covered on the house becuase it was not seasoned properly.

ChIJL-LC3WF0j1QRNLCiiLE5b4w,Tacofino,4.6,48.4280124,-123.3628844,2586,"Holy smokes these were delicious tacos!
I got the tuna taco and the yam taco.
The server recommended getting two and said it's the perfect amount, she was right! They were bigger than I expected as well!
The flavors of each taco were so different and amazing in their own way.
The restaurant is small and filled up very quickly for lunchtime and it was on a Tuesday, I can imagine a wait here on the weekends.
Food was quick and so fresh!
I will 100% be back and recommend this place to anyone visiting the area!
Thank you to the manager Kelsey Van Nes and the whole team at Tacofino for perfect delivery of our order and accommodating a food allergy!

These tacos really packed great flavour and the nachos had a great cook! Vegetarians will LOVE the yam tacos. I could eat those all day! Portion sizes were generous and the tacos came loaded just how I love them.

We will return again!
What‚Äôs not to love about Tacofino! This is the third location we‚Äôve eaten at and the experience was consistently top notch. We had the nachos which were a first for me-next time I‚Äôll ask for them to ‚Äúgo easy‚Äù on the beans (just to play it safe) Fish and Yam tacos were a hit as well, nice to see the taste and price come together so exceedingly well. Kudos guys we‚Äôll be back.
This is my first time visiting Victoria and I was recommended to check out Tacofino. I was extremely disappointed and left extremely unhappy. I paid $31.50 and felt like it was all a waste. I will never be going here again.

I ordered 2 Fish Tacos & 2 Crispy Chicken Tacos at 9:37pm. I waited outside for around 35 minutes for my order to be ready.

When I got to the car and looked at the tacos, I tried biting into the chicken tacos and the crispy chicken was literally rock hard batter. I started pulling the chicken pieces apart and it was all crispy batter, chicken skin, and no meat!!!! This is not high quality meat being used.

Is this place run by anyone? Feels like there‚Äôs absolutely no management leading the operations of this restaurant.
We planned part of our Victoria trip around this restaurant from excellent reviews and recommendations and it was so worth it. We ended up ordering way more food than the 2 of us could enjoy in an attempt to try various options. Absolutely left stuff in a food coma of bliss. The crispy chicken burrito, yam burrito, yam taco and fish tacos were just divine. The hard cider to accompany the meal was a perfect combo. Will definitely be back for more. Not a lot of free parking nearby so bare in mind to pay for your spot or expect an unpleasant surprise when you are back. Nothing abnormal for a downtown establishment.

The food was delicious, can‚Äôt say enough good things about the steak dish and green beans! Highly recommend this place for happy, hour, dinner, or hosting an event!
We visited for a late dinner and had a lovely experience. The staff were attentive and helpful, the food was delicious and the prices reasonable. We also met the owner who was super friendly and had some delicious suggestions for our meal. We are looking forward to returning soon.
We went to check out Tapas on Oak last week and had a fantastic night. The food offered a wide variety of tastes from around the world - from the Hong Kong dumplings to West Coast crab cakes, amongst other gems like the Karaage Chicken. All delicious. Great hospitality by the owner and excellent service by a fun staff. Nice selection of wines too, with a price point for all. Will definitely plan a return visit!
I have been to Tapas on Oak a couple of times and highly recommend it. Great food, good wine selection, and awesome service! Will definitely be going back.
Have been looking forward to trying this place for awhile and was disappointed. Large, heavy portions and price tags really took away from an authentic ‚Äútapas‚Äù experience. Food was meh. Good deal on wine by the glass for happy hour, but most on the list are from USA - only one option from Spain, few from other countries in Europe. Service was good and it wasn‚Äôt busy when we were there.

Food was absolutely incredible! Most outstanding dish for us was the pork belly appetizer! Everything else was so beautifully presented and all the flavors were on point making it a full on sensory experience -highly recommendüëåüëçüëç
Great food and wonderful service! The flavours were delicate and well balanced, yet super flavourful and unique. The presentation was beautiful. The service was great; We took our time and didn't feel rushed.
Worth the splurge!!!  Yes it's expensive. And yes it was amazing! Good things are worth spending money on and if you've never had a fine dining meal, this should be on your local list to try! Service was attentive and on point. The meals were paired wonderfully with reds and whites appropriately. We started off with a super fun creative chai inspired whiskey sour! If James has it available, order it!!! When they say their tenderloin is like butter, it's true. And yes, you should pair wine with your dessert!
It's a small venue, with small tables but the service keeps on top of your table helping to avoid clutter. Thanks Chef, James, and Ryan for the great time!
Absolutely love this place. Tried nearly every dish on the menu and enjoyed all of them.
Food is not cheap and a little floofy (small portions) but that is expected at this type of place and food.

I tried the scallop and beef entrees, both were fantastic. Our server was one of the best I've ever had as well, very nice guy and oddly decisive in helping us choose meals which was great

The beet salad with the airated goat cheese was quite something. The chocolate cake has a beet white chocolate ganache poured in the middle and was great
We came on a sunday without realizing that there is a set menu on sunday's, I was pretty skeptical going into it as the menu items sounded very unique and I am a tad on the fence when it comes to new foods. I was pleasently surprised by what we ordered, but I thought that everything was so close to perfection, yet not quite there yet because of the small details. Everything was presented beautifully, the cucumber salad and the beef carpaccio were delicious as appitizers. The steak was cooked to perfection and is from Alberta, as a person that grew up in Calgary, this was still proabably one of the best steaks that I've had. Although the fried hash with the steak had a burnt flavour because it was put into overcooked oil and the almond's with the halibut made the flavour of the whole dish bitter.
The desserts were amazing and I loved the sorbet's that were served as pallet cleansers, although it may be helpful if the server's could point that out as I imagine that not everyone would know to eat the dessert that way and the flavour is vastly different if you ate the sorbet with the main items of the dessert.
Service was fantastic, Shane was super attentive and personable. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience here and would definately recommend this resturant.

The service was impeccable, the food was beyond what my taste buds could handle, and the decor was astonishing!
I felt welcomed and the service was fast, sweet, and they were able to handle our dietary concerns (no seafood).

The drinks are very well made and the flavours were absolutely scrumptious.

I highly recommend this place for your next birthday dinner, or fancy date night!
Went for an early dinner and were very well served. Tried several of the vegan items on the menu, and everything was delicious! Roasted dumplings, spaghetti-squash with seasonal vegetables and veg-stuffed ravioli. The chef was very accommodating, which we really appreciated. The blueberry lemonade and mango-mint soda were very good too. Flavourful blood-orange sorbet to finish off. Vegans will be very happy here.
A great place for cocktails! I had the Empress 75 and it was delicious without being too sweet! I ate the Best Ravioli (not pictured) and it was so good. For dessert I had the pecan pie, and it was really tasty but hard to eat with a spoon; ask your server for a fork :)
ü§§ I love this place! The spaghetti squash is in another level!
We were short of time and wanted to eat something before taking the bus to the ferries‚Ä¶ they brought all our food on a timely manner as well as the drinks!
Service was wonderful
The next time I come to Victoria, will definitely eat at this place!!
One of the nicest restaurants! Beautiful ambiance, friendly staff, and my food was incredible! I had the plant based beet ravioli. It was the best vegan dish I‚Äôve had! It had so many beautifully blended flavours, it was creamy, filling, and satisfying. I also had dumplings for an appetizer and they did a really job cooking them. I paired my meal with the Summerhill sovereign opal and it tasted lovely. I ended the dinner with the blood orange sorbetto and it was sweet and creamy. My mom had the spaghetti squash and said it was really good and my step dad inhaled the burger it was so good. This place is a great place for vegans and non vegans.

ChIJGVp36490j1QRPBJt_PbDg4o,Fishhook,4.6,48.4241602,-123.3621417,1185,"Wasn't terribly impressed with this place. We tried the homemade sodas which were very strange and we couldn't finish either one.

My wife got the fish and chips. It was overly fried and probably below average for your typical bar.

I got the daily khatch. The seasoning was like average Indian food. Like the kind of stuff you'd get at a $14 all you can eat buffet. The one thing I did like was the Humboldt Squid. It tasted different than normal calamari, was super tasty, and made the whole experience worthwhile. If you're into calamari and seafood and never had Humboldt Squid, this is worth going to. Otherwise I'd recommend passing.
Amazing little restaurant we visited three times.
West coast seafood mixed with East Indian. Great combinations of flavors  and textures.
We had the house chowder and a salmon biriani. Both dishes tasted really good.
Great service and atmosphere.
We will be back!!
Fantastic Indian Seafood fusion spot. So much flavor. Chowder is not the creamy kind, which I liked. Seafood pot was super flavorful. Very unique, very tasty
Generous portion of fish and chips, and soup was pretty good with a nice kick of spice. For some reason the online ordering system didn‚Äôt work out for me, but enjoyed the dine in experience nonetheless as restaurant is very relaxed.
The fish chowder is just okay but the toasted bread come with it is the best!

Tuna melt is also highly recommended.

They take the last order 30mins before close- even take out order- be prepared

ChIJz2zj_I50j1QRMcEus2kdUrI,Cafe Brio,4.6,48.4239195,-123.3575989,443,"No surprise that the food and service was amazing. A medium sized menu with a nice variety of choices. Most have the option to get half portions so you try a few different dishes easily enough. I assumed the full portion would be smaller due to being a fancy joint but it was very filling.

I had the pork cutlet which was mouth watering. I tried the beat salad and carbonara pasta as well - both amazing.

The only thing to complain about, and you can probably tell from the photos, is the lighting! If it's so dark your wait staff carry flashlights to read the menu... It's probably too dark.

Would be happy to return!
This place was great. The atmosphere perfect. The bartender was friendly and made my friend a custom drink. The boards are delicious‚Ä¶the duck with the Brie and quince jelly was a 10/10 combo. My only regret was not getting the bartender‚Äôs name to put in the review because he was both authentic and kind.
Absolutely incredible meal - from service, to atmosphere, to quality of the fare. We had the lamb, fish of the day, steak, and cured meats (which are made in house), and cheeses. Everything was fresh, well balanced, and very flavourful. One of our new favourite staples in Victoria
Wonderful food and owner. Had the Beet salad, the Contorni, Tomato Salad, Chanterelle Mushroom Risotto, and Lamb feature (4 types). Superb for 2 people.
Such a beautiful evening!I was met warmly at the door by the owner (I believe) who made me feel like I was coming to visit a good friend. The atmosphere was inviting and comfortable. The lovely young lady serving us was so attentive without hovering. The food was just amazing. Each of our meals were thoughtfully prepared and just the right amount. Desserts were fantastic! Thank you all for a perfect evening!

I usually never write reviews, but for this place I had to. What an amazing experience! It‚Äôs a family owned business and you feel like you‚Äôre at someone‚Äôs home. They are friendly and welcoming. Food is outstanding, fresh, great quality, and portions are just right.

I will get back again and again!
I recently had the pleasure of dining at this Middle Eastern/Persian restaurant and was thoroughly impressed by both the food and the hospitality. The maquli bowl, which I ordered, was bursting with flavor and cooked to perfection. The portion size was generous and left me feeling satisfied but not overly full.

What really stood out to me, though, was the warmth and welcoming nature of the staff. From the moment I entered the restaurant, I was greeted with a smile and made to feel like a valued guest. Throughout my meal, the staff checked in on me to ensure that I was enjoying my food and had everything I needed.

Overall, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious Middle Eastern/Persian cuisine and a warm and welcoming dining experience. I will certainly be returning soon!
Absurdly tasty. The lamb schwarma wrap is a cacophony of many elements all individually seasoned and all making a taste symphony. Friendly service and a lovely, if understated, vibe.
The place is nice and the atmosphere is good. Service is good. My problem was the food. The meat was dry and not juicy. In the lafa, not enough salad, no tahini. The portions were kind of small for the price. Limonana is super sweet! Even my kids couldn't drink it. We had big expectations for the flavors and were disappointed.
Over the past few of years I‚Äôve walked pass by this place couple of times, finally today my friend and I finally paid a visit. We came in at the tail end of lunch time and there are still people ahead of us waiting to pick up their orders. From this phenomenon I can tell that over the years the locals have found this place a gem.
My chicken sharwama wrap tasted delicious. I tasted light curry and yogurt amongst the greens and chicken fillings. The wrap towards the end leaked out oil, while that might just be me not eating it fast enough/ in the right way.
Cashier knows the menu and is friendly. Your order gets brought to you when dinning in. Large glass/ plastic jug of water on the side free to fill.
All the staff are in the kitchen prepping food orders. I know I would feel more comfortable if the tables could be wiped down after each use or at set schedule. Marvelous that diners have been decent tiding up after themselves. Nevertheless, the virus is still around and death number still gets published.

The one thing is, it wasn‚Äôt busy or anything but I felt the service was very slow. Took a long time for them to come around to us. But the food is great ! The patio portion is heated and enclosed which is cool.
Browns is always a nice place to go for lunch. My mom enjoys their veggie burgers and I enjoy their selection of drinks. The service at Browns is always good and staff is always friendly. I decided to try their new brunch options and was a little disappointed however they are new and they might need time to perfect brunch.
There are a few Browns in town, we went to the one downtown which has good location, staff are friendly, allow reservation and more importantly it is not too busy as the one uptown.  Highly recommend.
Went looking for a place to have brunch. Had immediate seating which was a bonus on a Sunday morning in Victoria. Food was good and plentiful, but the potatoes were undercooked. Server was very nice and attentive.
Met a friend for happy hour. It would have been nice to have another choice of seating. So busy and plenty of hub-bub noise close to the service area and kitchen. Social white wine, gluten free dry ribs and chips and guacamole. Yummy The server was great. The bathrooms were clean. ‚úîÔ∏è

ChIJKarr3f51j1QRj1gzbW8bT3c,Ugly Duckling Dining & Provisions,4.8,48.4292439,-123.3680502,37,"Ugh, I really wish I could give Ugly Duckling a 5 star for the food as it was phenomenal - beautifully curated, pure and intense flavours, and gorgeous plating. Portions are to be expected for fine dining.

Service was friendly and professional, and it felt like the entire team worked together on service. It was a unique joy to get to meet the kitchen staff.

Unfortunately, despite all this, the wait times between tasting menu courses verged on unbearable, and brought my overall experience down to a max 4 star. We had a reservation for 8pm and left the restaurant at 1130pm, not by choice. It was fairly obvious that other tables had also felt weary, as we all waited on last courses there was more and more silence across the restaurant. A shame because the execution of food was spectacular, the menu well thought out, but time management matters and I truly have never waited so long between courses ü•∫ Sadly this was the main impression I left with rather than the food.

I‚Äôm hopeful that this issue will be mitigated once they change to tasting menu only. The food deserves to be experienced, but I can‚Äôt see myself returning or recommending anyone wait that long for fine dining.
Great little restaurant in Victoria‚Äôs Chinatown with outstanding food and really nice atmosphere.  We had the tasting menu of 7 courses if you count bread and petit fours. The food was absolutely amazing, Chinese milk bread with charred scallion butter, a trio of Chinese street food which include lamb, halibut and a scallop pure beautifully presented to be eaten with chopsticks, then we had cucumber where the water was replaced with champagne, served with thinly sliced albacore tuna, a halibut dish where the halibut was melt in your mouth with a miso buerre blanc, lamb with soybean cassoulet and a delicious dessert with white chocolate toffee sprinkle. Every dish was perfect. The wine list and pairing are also very well done. My only complaint is the timing of the service. A little too long between courses. Service was attentive and the servers were very friendly, but the kitchen needs to tighten up their timing. I love a relaxed pace, but it was just a little too relaxed. Despite that, I highly recommend this restaurant!!! Chef has nailed the food!!
What a wonderful dining experience‚Äîin this historic Chinatown building.  The seven course tasting menu was superlative. Beautifully plated and served at the perfect pace in order to enjoy each imaginative and delicious course. The halibut, the lamb, the tuna were such unique dishes, each cooked and garnished with such interesting combinations of fresh and imaginative ingredients.  Even a delightful presentation before dessert of a palate cleanser. And the dessert was perfect featuring in season strawberries. We especially enjoyed the enthusiastic and detailed explanation of each course as it was served. The staff are a great team, professional and attentive and so creative.  They made our dining experience very enjoyable and memorable. Thank you, too, for the fun presentation of apple juice to 3 year old Kieran !
This may have been the best dinner in my entire life. The tasting menu was inspired. The entire offering was spectacular.
Wow, what an incredible meal! It is hard to find full tasting menus like this in Victoria. I was very impressed by everything I ate.

Wow, simply the best food and experience.  Of course the views and vibes at the restaurant are what you expect‚Ä¶ sitting there makes you appreciate why Victoria is loved.  Service was friendly and welcoming.  Food was on another level, and the wine pairings were thoughtful and enjoyed. There is so much care, technique and experience put into the food.  With that in mind, I think the prices are on the low side.  Everywhere has increased their prices because of current issues surrounding operating restaurants in 2022 - so I feel you get quite a lot of value for their current pricing. It‚Äôs appreciated but understand if prices need to be adjusted.
It was such a peaceful experience eating with a sea view. We had brunch, which was chicken with waffles and eggs. The flavour in all the dishes was unreal, especially the soft texture of the waffles. We didn‚Äôt have a reservation but the staff was super nice and still gave us a view table. Couldn‚Äôt be any better. Big shoutout to Kaitlyn I believe, she was so friendly from saying hi to bye. She told us about the dishes and about places we could visit in Victoria while we were there. Overall, great staff and amazing food. On a side note, patio was closed when we visited so if you‚Äôre going to have a patio experience, just call the restaurant and confirm.
Would definitely give the overall High Tea experience at Aura a high score. The service was on point, the presentation beautiful, and the views are some of the best in the city. I also really loved the Japanese twist on most of the bites - starting with salmon aburi on an onikamiyaki pancake & a chicken katsu sandwich, ending with sesame tarts, matcha opera cake and more. But I did find myself wishing that all flavours were kicked up about two notches. Standouts we‚Äôre the glazed scone and katsu sandwich. Could live withouts include the pork bun, tamago sandwich and beets on a bun.
Great Western omelette and Aura Benedict! We enjoyed our stay in the hotel as well as our breakfast at Aura waterfront restaurant. We were also with 3 toddlers and they were kept busy with the provided drawing supplies which was nice.
The quality of food and service  is pretty good, for sure.
But the portion is smaller than smaller. Also, I‚Äôm not a fan of the coffee (written as espresso but served as normal black coffee), a lot of spaces for improvement.

All gender washroom on opposite side of the ravine. Nice well to do children's playground and work out/exercise equipment and or infrastructure or what have you. Locals did not seem bothered by my presence. Some were even friendly.
I chose Cecilia Ravine to be my first experience on this type of thing. I throughly enjoyed myself. My only complaint is how short the trails are and how overall small the park is. It doesn't take long for it to be busy  and you have to watch out for little kids on balance bikes.
The park is poorly maintained and a lot of the features are quite worn. If you live close-by this is a great place to hop into but if you need to drive i recommend North Saanich Bike Park.
Well maintained and great location...perfect track for any age...young or old...big or small...my boys (18 & 14) love it!!
The park is good, up to a certain extent, poorly maintained, water builds up at the bottom of the easy track and 1 spot on the ""hardest"" track, the difficulty for the tracks aren't the best either because the ""harder"" track (ranked as blue) is more difficult than ""hardest"" (ranked as black), I also think adding a few rocks into the trails could make it better  for new people, there are also some issues with the drop into the ""hardest"" track it has been worn down are the landing making it slightly unstable to land on and there isn't enough of a run up to clear it, there are also some visitor created trails that lead to jumps and one off the side of the park, but the park is good for new people

Amazing customer service! In August, I chose to do a day rental and half way through my trip I unfortunately got into a accident which caused damage to the bike and myself. Not only did the staff not charge me for my abruptly shortened rental or damage but they also took time to patch me up too. They were very kind! They offer multiple bike options are all well kept and in good condition. Moreover, they have various tours, and rental options available to suit all riders and trip durations. My experience has been outstanding so I would definitely recommend them if you're looking to rent a bike or do a city tour.
Wow! What a great experience. So wonderful to get out on the bike in the fresh air with a knowledgeable and personable guide. Ian was great as a tour guide and it was fabulous to get into some of the backstreets of Victoria. Great service. Great quality bikes and equipment. Thank you. I'd highly recommend The Pedaler.
The city gardens tour was fun and educational.   Barbara has amusing stories of their quirky histories and takes you to several very different gardens.  Best to take some snacks; we had just enough time in each garden to have a bite, a few sips and to learn how each garden is unique.  The views were easy to access on the e-bike. We didn‚Äôt spend too long in any one place, and the tour lasted just the right amount of time.  Thanks for a different look at Victoria‚Äôs ‚Äúother‚Äù gardens.

Excellent service! I‚Äôve been taking our families bikes here for 4 years and I couldn‚Äôt be happier with the service the shop provides. Also, for you Yeti riders, go see Andrew, he‚Äôs a magician!
Peter and Andrew from BSC took care of me in time of emergency. I broke my handlebar on Thursday before my Ironman70.3 race on Sunday, I‚Äôm from out of town and never been to Victoria before. So I frantically called & sent emails to bike shops around town to get a replacement.
Peter from BSC replied immediately that they might have it. So I immediately went there with the bike, and it was the right one!

What an amazing team!  This company is absolutely wonderful!  Thanks so much for always taking care of me when i drop in with loose bike parts and need custom orders.

The city is very cycle-friendly and we were able to see everything we wanted to in the few hours we were there, without paying over the top prices with the cruise excursion packages. The bikes were super great condition and we were provided with helmets and a bike lock, and the employee that helped us (Matt) was so nice and helpful, showed us spots on the map to check out and was available by phone if we wanted any other recommendations. So happy with this experience and if we ever end up in Victoria again we will do it again for sure!
Visited Victoria on the Quantum of the Seas. We had no plans for what to do in Victoria but wanted to explore a bit. This was right at the terminal, and the owner(s) were great about getting us set up and giving us a map with places to go. Beacon Hill Park was absolutely gorgeous, and even riding down the coast line was a view I'll remember for awhile.

I will say that their website needs updating. It says $25 per person but we were charged $40 each. I imagine this is a holdover from when they shut down during the pandemic. That being said, $40 per person seems reasonable to me for what we got. Just keep that in mind if you actually read  look at the website ahead of time unlike we did.

The owner made us feel welcome in Victoria and we had a great time. Great option if you want to see the city and do so at your own pace.
We had an amazing time renting bikes from the Cruise Port in Victoria. VBR made it super easy. Their staff was very friendly and gave us great suggestions on where to ride. They had a nice selection of bikes and even gave us helmets, bike locks and a backpack to carry out stuff. It was a little further to town than we wanted to walk but got there on bike in 10 minutes. Highly recommended!
We had a great experience with Victoria bike rentals! We walked over from our hotel, it was really easy to find and get started biking right away. Price was reasonable and they gave us great ideas of places to bike. I‚Äôm glad they were open for evening biking because the other bike rental place closer to our hotel closed early. Definitely recommend!
Quick and easy bike rental experience. Rented 1 hybrid (non e bike) in April 2023. I walked up and rented a bike with no hassle. Was provided a map and a few suggestions of places to check that suited my interests. Was provided a helmet and a lock for the rental. Highly recommended for those that want to get a little bike ride in and check out all the cool spots around town.

Had a great experience renting beautiful gravel bikes from David for a 5 day tour around the area with 2 girlfriends. He was very accommodating in meeting us a locations convenient to us when we started and finished our tour. Thanks for a great trip!
Rented a road bike for the day. Bike was in excellent shape. Drop off and pick up delivery was terrifically convenient. Service was friendly, prompt and overall top notch.
Rented road bikes for Victoria 70.3. Bikes, set-up, delivery and pick-up were fantastic. Thanks, David!
I had an amazing experience renting a bike from North48 for the Victoria IM 70.3. David helped deliver the bike directly to bike Check-In, and he set me up with a real ripper! The bike was exactly setup to my own bike specs and ended up being as comfortable as my own. I highly recommend renting from North48!! Thank you!!!

ChIJFWyBO5t0j1QRoaE9XIuo9Sg,Capital Bike,4.7,48.4397635,-123.3576711,12,"I took the bike skills and safety course for adults  from Capital Bike. Super course. It was very informative and fun. Best thing I could have done for safely riding in the city. I wish motorists had the same information.
The Capital Bike Course is for everyone. Beginner cyclists can learn the rules and etiquette of the road and avid cyclists can get out of bad habits. This cycling course gave me confidence and skills to safely get my family and I around Victoria. We use our bikes significantly more than I did before. Considering the rising cost of gas and food, cycling is saving our family buckets! I'd highly recommend everyone, including drivers, take the Capital Bike course.

Instructors were kind, understanding, and very helpful. They didn't make me feel silly nor talked down to beginners learning to bike. They always made us feel safe and heard. Very great listeners and speakers in the classroom and helpful tips and encouragement for practical riding outdoors.
I  recently attended the all day Ebike skills Course offered by Capital Bike. I found it to be a comprehensive, informative, well paced,  course consisting of  three components -  classroom, hands-on skill building and a group ride. I  highly recommend it!
I took the Bike Skills Course. I hadn't been on a bike in many years. This course was perfect in length and information so I could feel safe to start riding my bike around town. The teachers were enthusiastic and knew the city well for our practice ride around town. I learned a lot about the bike infrastructure.
The bike skills course I did with Jaye is one of the best things I've ever done for myself.  Nervous adult who knows I should bike more and drive less but lacked confidence and experience. After one day I felt a thousand times better and now I know I can bike anywhere!

In 2022 I took my bike in for a crankset installation and as a ""courtesy"" they tuned my derailleur.   Not only did I not ask them to touch my derailleur, but it was the worst tune I'd ever seen in my life.  There was nothing wrong with it before and they actually ended up damaging it.  I took it back and they fixed the tune but now it makes a noise over every bump which it never used to do.

Recently I decided to give them a second chance.  I needed a damper service for my shock and they're one of the only shops in town that do it in-house (as opposed to sending it away to the mainland).  Through no fault of their own, the job was not able to be complete, but when I got my bike back they had contaminated my front brake and I had to buy new pads.

I'm sure most people have better luck with them than I did, but even if there's a small chance that they compromise your brakes, do you want to take that risk?  There are plenty of competent shops in town. I strongly recommend avoiding this one when it comes to repair and service.
I dropped my bike off in need of a larger seat for my daughter on the back and I was in a hurry! The staff were so kind, they found me the right seat immediately - It was ready for pick up THE SAME DAY.  This is amazing considering what a busy time of year it is for bike repair etc. I was blown away and won't go anywhere else for bikes in Victoria : )
Went in looking for a screw to replace the ones I lost from my kryptonite lock that I bought from another shop and they found a screw and gave it to me free of charge! A great help and really shows what a great attitude they have at this shop, would definitely come back.
Just about as solid a bike shop as you‚Äôll find. We recently purchased a new FS MTB for our son here and the team that helped us knew their stuff and seemed to provide trustworthy guidance on what we needed for age/weight and riding needs. Parking in the back.
Excellent service and great range of bikes and equipment

This service is a great idea and I appreciate that they have expanded their hours of operation, but it needs to further expand them so that people working downtown outside of 9-5 can truly benefit. It closes when it's needed most (when there's the most theft).

Local businesses should focus on initiatives like this rather than crying over government employees working from home.
Like the security hate the service. I checked my bike Saturday noon June 3rd older lady looking after customers was snippy and had a real attitude. She didn't seem comfortable handling bikes, especially the bigger e-cargo bikes. Didn't instill a lot of confidence that my new bike was in good hands. I offered to help her with it, and that's when she snapped back, "" No one's allowed back here."" I almost wanted to just ride away. If you can't be courteous to people coming downtown to shop, it's just another reason why not to come downtown.
Just used it today, Sunday March 19, 2023.  Best part is a FREE registration to Project 529 Garage.  Improves your chances at getting your bike back if it stolen.
Overall very efficient and friendly.  You get a bike tag on a ring with a clip.  Easy to connect to your other keys if you are carrying them.
I‚Äôve used it four or five times now and spent more time walking around town and shopping/eating because it. I hope to see this made permanent and expanded. Although the free price is nice, if a modest fee can help it become permanent and expand that would be well worth it. Perhaps this could be the seed for several more locations that would evolve into an access-card controlled system where the access cards double as transit passes‚Ä¶

Highly Recommend !!!!! Five Stars..... Jamie is a highly qualified e-bike expert. Absolutely no pressure sales, and first-rate service. Jamie is a one man show, and has incredible patience. If you are even remotely thinking about an e-bike, you should visit Cit-E Cycles. I am thrilled with my Cube Reaction Hybrid Pro 500 Allroad. It has taken me places I would otherwise never get to go. The first day I rode it out of the shop, down to the Blue Bridge, and took the Galloping Goose all the way to Sooke. 55K !!! The next day I rode past the Sooke Potholes, and up to Leechtown. I now have almost 500k on it, and I will never look back !!!
Jamie helped answer my questions, made sure the bike I wanted was the right size and fit correctly. A week later brought it back for an adjustment to smooth out the shifting and he took care of it right on the spot. A great experience overall.

Both men were OUTSTANDING. I truly appreciated the time Lucas spent with me when I was choosing which bike to purchase. I came in knowing how much I wanted to spend, what specifics I was looking for in a bike, and what my concerns were. He went above and beyond explaining everything to me and I am so grateful to him!!! He found me a bike almost instantaneously that was exactly in my price range, helped me understand all the intricate details I didn‚Äôt know about the bike and what I should look for, and his relatable and upbeat, energetic manner is unflappable.

Best bike repair shop in town üëå I had initially tried a different business but they had a waitlist of two weeks. North Park was able to take me in much more quickly, and for a better price. Knowledgeable staff that takes the time to explain the work they'll be doing and why, fair prices, same-day pickup, and a great location (the cafe next door has my favourite lemon cakes in town). My bike now runs smoothly and my breaks are in great shape. Highly recommend!
Needed a rather specific and not too common tire on short notice and they had it in stock! Pleasant, courteous and informative. Their display floor is packed with quality bikes and accessories to meet the needs of your average commuter (who may want above average quality accessories) or those who do touring and bikepacking. I'll be visiting them again.
Ive been there a few times to service my bike now, and every single time they are so thoughtful and friendly when they help out. They put the bike up ok the hoist and actually go steo by step with you as to whats going on. Honestly its the best bike service place ive ever been to. Super transparent about pricing, and super transparent about the work they do. It seems like the work environment is really great for everyone that works there, and it shows in their service
My bike was looooong overdue for a tune up and these guys were so helpful through the entire experience. I felt fully informed throughout the whole experience, from the booking of an appointment, to walking me through the estimate and diagnostic process, up to pick-up and payment day.  I appreciated the communicative staff and mechanics who ensured I was aware of all the things that needed taking care of - and some unexpected, but necessary replacements after thorough inspection. Super excited to riding my bike again, knowing it's had a full once-over with thoughtful attention to detail. Thanks for your hard work!

Unfortunately, shortly after leaving the shop I had a crash due to a defective part from the manufacturer (not fitted by the guys at the shop) so took my bike straight back to them for some repairs. Despite it not being their fault at all, they replaced the defective part and a few others that had been damaged in the crash completely free of charge!

Cannot recommend these guys enough, absolutely brilliant service and will certainly be going back to them for any future work or bike-related purchases I need!

If you need a basic tune up there‚Äôs lots of shops for that in town w a faster turn around but I would definitely recommend them for any major services
To the staff that helped me with a broken crank arm last night and instead of just tightening the arm lile i asked, diagnosed the problem and found me an amazing fix. This is amazing customer service. I'll be back tonight after work to drop off payment.
This is way above and beyond.
Incredible service! I am new to cycling, and I don't know much about bicycles yet. I was at the store for almost 2 hours, as every inner tube I bought kept popping due to my own error.

Him and Aaron always say ""We'll look after you"" and it's the truth. I'm always looking for a reason to spend money and Aaron always talks me out of it, even suggesting products from different stores sometimes. I've been to other bike shops in town and none of them offer the value, honesty and customer service that I get from Russ Hays. Ben in service has been an incredible addition to the gang too. They always manage to fit my bike in if I have any issues, and never act annoyed if I have a million questions (yes I'm that guy). Honestly everyone in service really knows their stuff and are happy to talk shop. I could go on and on about these guys. Russ Hays is the GOAT!
Awesome friendly staff! Were wonderful pulling a massive nail out of my tire even letting me watch how they did the repair and answering my questions about prevention. Also bought a lock which I had a rare issue with a sticky key, they exchanged easy and got me set up with a new one quickly, I didn't even have to go through the lock company. Thank y'all!
I went into Russ Hays hoping to get a piece installed in my handle bars to allow me to be more upright on my Specialized Vedo. Aaron was the solutions guy and found and installed exactly what I needed while we chatted. Knowledgeable, efficient, kind. A 5 star experience. Thank you!
My wife wanted to try couple of the Specialized trail/mountain bikes and I had called few days ahead. Very helpful on the phone took the time to look up stock and even called me back to let me know they had the bikes on hand. When we got there Ryan and his team made sure all the bikes were setup to my wife's specs which made a world of difference. We were never rushed and Ryan made sure to answer any questions we had. And also went over the bike in detail.   We ended up purchasing the Specialized Rockhopper Expert and since we didn't have our bike rack he was kind enough to offer to have one of his colleagues who lives near us bring it out to us! And to boot his colleague spent more time to go over few other details with my wife on the bike use. Fantastic service and great and extremely knowledgeable staff all around.
I brought in a new motor to be laced into my existing e-bike wheel, which required all of the spokes to be removed. Needless to say I quickly realized the job was too big for me‚Ä¶ I brought it into (Ben) the pros at Russ Hay‚Äôs, and they fixed it up for me in record time.

They're amazing. They're friendly and considerate, and incredibly helpful with picking out what's best for your family. And once you have it, they're super helpful with repairs and maintenance.
They also have a good selection of just about everything, so even if you're just looking for a new helmet or bell, they have you covered.

Can‚Äôt say enough positive things about this place.  The customer service is excellent.  The e-cargo bike inventory is the best in town. Robert is very knowledgeable and worked hard to find us the perfect bike for our family.  Unfortunately, the first bike we bought was recalled and had to be sent back to the manufacturer.  Robert helped us through that and even lent us his own personal e-cargo bike for a few weeks while we were without, which was incredibly generous.

They also have great accessories like bike lights, bells etc. Highly recommend, the service is wonderful and the employees are friendly!

I could not be happier with my purchase and will be back for my future bike needs. Shout out to Adam, Rhy, and Mike!
I had my bike fitted by Mike at Fort Cycle and tuned up by the excellent service crew there a week before my first Olympic triathlon.  The advice and expertise that I received from Mike and others at Fort Cycle truly made an enormous difference to my performance on the bike.  The bike was perfectly calbrated for an efficient and comfortable ride!!    I highly recommend for anyone who is cycling a lot to have your bike set up optimized by Mike!  It is 100% worth it!!
I have been a Fort Street client for decades.  I enjoy the location, layout of the store and for many years I have enjoyed the customer service and level of support.  I noticed quite a few changes since the change in ownership a few years ago but found the level of friendliness from the new staff helped make up for any shortcomings.

This summer I brought in my p3 for a full-service overhaul, while the work was done in time, once I got back on the bike, I felt that the level of performance was not what I had experienced in the past for work done, parts replaced and cost.  I brought the bike back and asked them to dial it in.  While they accepted the additional work, I found the chief mechanic to be begrudging and when the bike was retuned it performed a bit better but still was not at the level of quality I expected in terms of performance or cleanliness.

Around the same time, I dropped of my mountain bike and asked them to look to see what work might need to be done.  I asked them to please contact me with a quote depending on what they found.  Instead, when they contacted me, it was to tell me that they had completed a full overhaul to the tune of almost $300.  When I picked up the bike, I noticed that again, the performance was not in line with the level of service and cost.  In fact, when I checked it over it seemed like no work had been done except replacing the chain which was something that I had not asked for and did not need to be done as the bike was only 2 years old and did not have the amount of ride time to account for a new chain.  It also felt that no derailleur adjustments had been made for the new chain.  I also noticed a new sound when I spun my back wheel that had not been present before.  I took the bike back and asked them to look.  This time I found the shop staff (not the sales staff) to be outright hostile.  They made a few minor adjustments and when I asked about the sound, they told me it was a bent disc rotor.  When I told them the issue was not present when I brought the bike in, they told me I was welcome to purchase a replacement part.  Then I had a mechanic friend look at the bike and they advised me that as I suspected some of the work, I had been charged for had not been completed.

It‚Äôs clear that Fort St is no longer interested in offering any level of service, support or customer satisfaction.  They have continued to raise the costs for their labour while the quality has deteriorated.  If you are considering taking your business there, I suggest you find another shop as I now have.

Wow, I am blown away by the amazing customer service and work these guys do! I brought my well used commuter bike into them for some repairs and a tune and I cannot believe the difference. I feel like it rides better than it did when I first got it! Plus, all the work was completed in a few hours so I did not miss out on my commute. I cannot recommend Straight Up Cycles enough :) Thanks for the amazing work!
Amazing experience. Very knowledgeable guys, gave us straightforward recommendations and fixed my tire in 20-30 mins with us dropping in! Will be back ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Guys took me in on a moments notice, to do a difficult wheel true on a very rare 1980 Kuwahara bmx. They did an amazing job! Way above and beyond expectations. I trust them with any job after seeing them work. Really great price on the bill too I might add. Very reasonable!
Straight Up Cycles delivers amazing mechanics service, and genuine and judgement-free customer service. As someone who has worked in the bike industry in Vancouver in shops, as well as through nonprofit work supporting at-risk youth looking for employment in the bike mechanics industry, I am well-versed in the improvements that are needed in the bike industry. Many people feel like going to bike shops is daunting, because they have experienced sales staff and mechanics essentially making fun of their bikes, acting pretentious towards them, or assuming they don't know something about their bikes because of their gender, or because they aren't a white guy.

I took my mountain bike in for a brake bleed, and the service upon intake and pickup were wonderful. I recently moved to Victoria for school and am not familiar with the mountain biking around here, and after I asked, Tim and Richie took the time to thoroughly recommend me some trails and ways of finding mountain biking community. The price for the blake bleed was also reasonable, and they even wiped down my dirty bike (fresh from some riding on Fromme in vancouver over the break). As I left, Tim went to get the door for me so it was more accessible for me to walk out, with my mountain bike. It's these little but big things that show they care, and it makes the experience for the customer that much more comfortable and happy. My partner and I both own two bikes each, both of which we have built up ourselves, and I will continue to recommend Straight Up cycles to my friends as a safe space that offers high-quality mechanics work, and sincere customer service.

Also, bike mechanics are highly skilled and creative people that need to be able to problem solve effectively and also ideally have great interpersonal skills for customer service (which is hard to find!). and Canada currently does not have a certification system for bike mechanics, which means that they don't have great wage protection (it will vary from shop to shop of course, but this means that there's no systematic way to guarantee that a bike mechanic that has improved their skills through there x amount of years working in the industry, will be able to get a certain set wage increase). So please be kind and patient with bike mechanics, and also if it is within your means, please tip when you can!

ChIJeYH8we9zj1QRI-e5Zk1l-PM,Macs Cycle Centre,4.6,48.45934399999999,-123.3322118,95,"I needed to replace the clamp on my bike seat, which other shops had sold out of, and was in a hurry. Service was very friendly, efficient and affordable. Google maps sent me to the back of the shop, so it took a minute for me to find it but it was well worth it - 5 stars for the service and price (its not their fault Google maps can be glitchy) Just make sure you go to the front of the store on Shelbourne :) I‚Äôll definitely be coming back for any cycling needs!
Maintenance less expensive than other places, very friendly staff, fast service (no need to wait 2 weeks until next availble appointment). Not a 5 star rating because of a single thing - the chain looks super dirty while they claim they cleaned it.
I had bought a bike from Mac Cycles back in 2008. I only went to this bike shop to get tune ups, repairs, get new parts, etc.  I like to shop local and support local business if I can.  I returned today with my old bike looking to buy a new one and be rewarded for my loyalty with a deal.  I reviewed their bikes, they told me the price for what I wanted and I asked for a deal for my support to their business after 14 years.  They offered me nothing except two tune-ups.  Very disappointing.  If you're looking for a bike shop that will be loyal to you as you support their business, Don't go to Mac Cycles!.. There are lots of bike shops in Victoria to choose from. Review them carefully.  Happy Bike Shopping!...Elsewhere :)
I brought my son‚Äôs bike in for a front break fix. The guys fixed right there for no charge as it was a simple fix. They were very friendly and helpful, I would highly recommend their shop
Macs Cycle Center sets the bar for outstanding value and service! Look no where else for your cycling needs.

Besides my favorite brands like Ortlieb, Tern or Brooks, they also carry recumbent trikes and bikes of different brands incl. AZUB recumbents. The staff know their stuff very well and will help you even with very special needs and requests. Very recommended.
I came in carrying my wheel,  spoke to a counter person and began to look around. Good selection of bikes , electric  and manual  with a wide price range
I left 10 minutes later with a fresh tube and a big smile. Price was 24$
Think about the world but shop where you live
I took the intro to mechanics course with my 11 yr old son over spring break.  It was awesome.  Michael got him interested and held his attention for hours.  I now have a wheel-truing expert and someone who loves to work on his bike.  Highly recommend it if you are interested in learning the fundamentals that you can build upon.
Henry fixed my recurring brake issue in about 5 seconds AND showed me how to address it in the future. I'm super happy and grateful for the great service and will be coming back in the future for sure. Thank you!
Simply the best‚Ä¶and wish they had a shop in Ottawa.

I broke the O-ring on my garmin holder and they helped me out by finding a replacement without a charge.

If you ever create a shirt or hat with your logo, let me know and I will order one online.

We covered so much distance and were able to see so much! The bikes are easy to operate. The staff are lovely and knowledgeable. They provided an overview of the bikes, and gave suggestions on what trails & routes to follow üòä Will definitely be renting e-bikes from Pedego Victoria again!
I was an ebike virgin and you know what they say; the first time can be awkward but I will definitely do it again! The attendant was very helpful and informative, she really settled my nerves. Overall brilliant fun, highly recommended!
Such a great time learning and riding these bikes!  We rode around much of Victoria and saw things we haven‚Äôt seen before plus we could pit as much exercise into it as we wanted to. The staff were very helpful and kind. What an awesome time we had and I highly recommend this experience!
Great service, location (that smoothie/coffee place was great too!) The only thing I‚Äôd say is, my bike wasn‚Äôt a great fit for me - and even though we did a test drive of about a block it took me about 5-10 minutes to realize it was a bit too small and my knees started to hurt. Maybe we looked like bike pros or something (haha) but we could have done with a touch more service at the initial booking to make sure we got helmets and bikes that fit our bodies. Cheers!
We had wanted to rent E Bikes in Victoria and went to Pedego bike rentals. Their location was conveniently located near the inner harbour and also nice, clean and new. The staff were helpful in getting us set up and we were able to enjoy a nice 24km bike ride downtown and on the many trails around Victoria. We recommend Pedego to anyone and will use them again the next time we are in Victoria.

Charles took his time to understand my needs, find me a great bike and all the things I‚Äôd need to get started. Friendly, knowledgeable and building a real community here. LOVE this place can‚Äôt recommend it enough
I had an amazing experience shopping at this store! Charles and the rest of the staff are incredibly kind and friendly. They gave me great information about all the bikes and were accommodating with taking test rides. They made picking out a bike a very relaxed and fun experience. I can't recommend them enough for their expertise and friendliness!
I absolutely love the ebike I bought from this shop a few years ago when they were still in Oak Bay. Its been my main source of transportation and it‚Äôs still going strong. Since purchasing I‚Äôve had some maintenance from them including a tire change, a tune-up and most recently the power switch/computer replaced.  They are always friendly, straight forward, and fair.  I would definitely recommend you buy your bike from this shop.  They have great products and great customer service.
Excellent service and attention to detail! The level of care from Charles, Alexandra and the rest of the team is unmatched - thank you so much for a wonderful experience. Highly recommended!
I can't say enough about the care and customer service Charles provided when I purchased my first e-bike. I am a tall and heavier cyclist and Charles and his team took the time to work with me to find a bike that stands up to a daily trail commute. My initial choice did not fit my daily commuting needs and Charles provided excellent support and allowed me to trade up to a Kona El Kahuna that has proved to be exceptionally reliable and durable.  Charles and team are professional, courteous, knowledgeable and always stand by their product and service.  I  recommend Charles and his team to everyone who needs a bike, service or expert advice.

BEWARE BEFORE YOU BUY MAKE SURE YOU THINK ABOUT IT PROPERLY OR YOU LOSE $40.00. We try their electric scooter 350 display model, we decide to get one and pay. Now, we choose a new one display to bring home. The display has different feeling, the stem of the scooter is not smooth when you turn it. Since it has no warranty and we didn‚Äôt bring it home yet, we decided not to continue it! They won‚Äôt refund us without a charge, they charge us for $40.00 fee.
We were wandering the mall and popped in as the electric folding bikes caught our eye.  Staff was awesome, took us out to test drive before purchasing.  Definitely are ideal for our needs as we can fold up and store in our motorhome. Thank you for the great service  very knowledgeable team.
I walked in, asked alot of questions. Was very pleased how I was treated. They answered all my questions. I didn't feel pressured into buying. But went in for more information about the ebikes, I walked out with all my questions answered. Very professional experience I felt. These are great guys to speak with. Highly recommend if you're looking for an ebike with great prices.
So happy to have bought a Columbus E Bike from Oliver today at Slane Cycles in Mayfair Mall. Great price point, reassurance that they stand behind the warranty and service. Thanks Oliver!! ü§ìüòé

Purchased a Giant FastRoad SL1on Mar.10 from Dylan while visiting in Victoria. Love the bike. Great service! Dylan was extremely knowledgeable, patient with questions, zero sales pressure, helped me to select and quickly install various accessories after a test ride. Even offered to box the bike for shipping on return flight home. Highly recommend.
I bought an Escape 2 Disk model from this store in June 2020. Since then I have ridden this bike for over 3000 KM across British Columbia.
I did the annual service check-up last year, the service was great, and the staff was super friendly.
I usually have ridden it mostly in steep hills and so I had to change the Freehub Body this year and they were super fast in checking the stock availability for the part. I'm so happy with the service at their store and the owner, Tyson, is very supportive.
I'm embarrassed to say I've never owned my own bike.
You'll find me on foot, on a run, or a hike.

I've moved to the island and it's my moment to shine.
Living in Vic, I knew it was time.

On Christmas morning an ornament hung from the tree.
A piece of cardboard with a bike drawn on it....could it be?

I was thrilled to find my bike at the Giant store on Yates.
The fact they had stock, we knew it was fate.

When we walked inside we were greeted by Frankie, a puppy, chillin'.
Quickly the real help came with a man named Dylan.

Long story short, the Liv Alight 2 in slate grey is all mine.
You better believe that im cruising I'm looking fiiiine.

Thank you for your help, I think I'm all set.
But I may stop by to give Frankie some pets.
On Vacation and next trip I will order my bike in advance. They let me demo bikes and will assist in boxing it up to return to Ontario. Excellent service and product knowledge!!

The tools are a bit rusty and warn, but it's a good idea to examine the bike and clean it a bit (use an old sock) before heading to Recyclistas to get your bike tuned up.   A cleaner Bicycle will get you better quality service than a dirty Bicycle (it shows that you care about your bike - and you'll save a bit of money in the long run).

What's missing is a water fountain... (Handy to wash your hands after messing with the bike a bit).
If you are stuck and need some help, then help yourself here.

ChIJYc9sJE1zj1QRSWVvTEqm3LA,Bungay's Bespoke Bicycle Service,5.0,48.4318718,-123.3868628,111,"I can't speak highly enough of Scott Bungay.  He knows bikes inside and out.  I brought my 26 year-old Klein road bike to him in the hopes that he could bring it back to life.  I had heard through word of mouth that he was the guy to talk to.  As the years passed since the 1990's I replaced various parts - foolishly not sticking with original components.  I wanted the bike restored as close to original condition as possible.  That included just using vintage Dura-Ace components that would match the original hardware. I also needed a ceramic rim for the rear wheel.  The front handlebars started to make a creaking noise some time ago on climbs.  The previous bike mechanic couldn't figure that out.  In any event, Scott looked high and low - worldwide - for replacement parts and found them.  He also suggested blue Ti bolts and blue handlebar tape  to help bring out the blue lettering on the white bike (see pictures).  It looks beautiful now.  It's silent on climbs.  It has all the parts that I hoped to see back on it.
I brought my ebike and road bike for tune up and Scott did not hesitate to help me with my concerns.  Very knowledgeable when it comes to all kinds of bikes.
Approachable and has willingness to attend your needs when it comes to bike. Great job.
Bungay's Bespoke Bicycle Service is first rate.  I read the reviews and booked an appointment for a tune up and servicing of a used MTB I had just purchased. Scott went over the bike with me when I arrived and determined it needed more than just a tune up and the servicing I requested.  He  was able to get all the work done  in the same time frame at a fair price, very impressive.
I am thankful to have discovered him based on Google reviews so I decided I'd write one in case someone else is looking for a reliable, talented professional who gets the job done on time with no upselling. Simply the best.I brought my bike from Nanaimo and will continue to do so in the future. Thank you Scott and thanks to the people who took the time to write these reviews and helped me discover Bungay's Bespoke Bicycle Service.
Had annual service. Scott's  was friendly, professional. He offered opinion /advice when asked, as I wasn't sure what I needed, other than a few obvious things. But he did not make any sales pitches /upsells. He completed the work in the timeframe suggested, and the price was fair. The change in the way my bike runs is astronomical. Thank you for great work, I'm excited to be back on the road!! Will return and would definitely recommend.
I rarely leave reviews, but Scott absolutely deserves the praise you see in these Google reviews. Scott has some impressive machinist skills, too. He even built me some custom e-bike parts out of titanium for a very fair price. Go support this small business.

ChIJzU9r3G90j1QRrvfigNT-uSU,JK's Bicycleitis Inc Bay St,4.7,48.4338987,-123.3345435,118,"Amazing bike shop. Jeremy knows his way around bicycles. It shows in his attention to detail and thorough customer service. He helped me pick out a bike that would best suit my needs, gave me tons of info about the bike, and was very hands on. He had me ride the bike to see how it felt the day I picked it up as well to make sure I was happy with it. I would definitely recommend this bike shop. The 30 years in business really shows. Thanks Bicycleitis! You da best!
I'm grateful I took my bike to Bicycleitis after the last quote I got for my old bike cost the same as a decent used one. I was about to garbage my bike! Bicycleitis worked with me on my budget, repair was quick, and service friendly too. It always feels good helping a small business to boot.
Got in an accident and dropped my bike off an hour before they closed for the weekend. I had it back they day they opened back up. It was so fast and everyone that helped was friendly and helpful. Would not recommend getting hit by a car, but I would definitely recommend coming here if you do.
Great, fast & affordable service, very friendly staff. This shop might be small but they have a ton of hard to find parts on-hand. I also really like that work very hard a breathing new life into older bicycles
100% the shop to use when getting fair deals on donated/used stuff. All the staff are very knowledgable & are super friendly whether you call or just show up. I recently spent $200 & checked everything off my list. they even looked in the back for some certain things that were not out on display. that's top notch service to me.

I always have some laughs when going in there. we all share the excitement of building cool bikes. they even complimented my personal bike!

their used section is smaller, but the parts are in all good working order, as they don't just throw every donated piece in there, aka junk. So I was able build up a bike super quick because of the great service & get it on the road for my buddy. I'll definitely be using the shop again because 1) it's fun going in there, and 2) they're selection of wolftooth narrow-wide chainrings (just randomly notice before I left) is INSANE! so many colours!!!

has Arnold Schwarzenegger would say it;

I'LL BE BACK.

Amazing customer service, great scooter ride along beach drive ‚õ±Ô∏è to mount Douglas, and Uvic Finnerty garden.
We were visiting Victoria for four nights and wanted to cycle a couple of bike routes so we went to Cycle BC to rent an e-bike for my husband.  Marty was super helpful in directing us on the best trails, good turn around points, and other points of interest along the way. I brought my own peddle bike from home, but the rear fender unfortunately got damaged on our way to Victoria from the mainland and Marty went out of his way to help me make my bike rideable still.  Friendly staff, good service, and good location for hopping onto a number of different trails from the harbor area.
